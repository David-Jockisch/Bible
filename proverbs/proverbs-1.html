        <h1>Proverbs 1</h1>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h3>The Beginning of Knowledge</h3>
        <p><b>1 </b>The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight,</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity;</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth—</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>Let the wise hear and increase in learning,
            and the one who understands obtain guidance,</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>to understand a proverb and a saying,
            the words of the wise and their riddles.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge;
            fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
            <h3>The Enticement of Sinners</h3>
        <p><b>8 </b>Hear, my son, your father's instruction,
            and forsake not your mother's teaching,</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>for they are a graceful garland for your head
            and pendants for your neck.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>My son, if sinners entice you,
            do not consent.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>If they say, “Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood;
            let us ambush the innocent without reason;</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>like Sheol let us swallow them alive,
            and whole, like those who go down to the pit;
        </p>
        <p><b>13 </b>we shall find all precious goods,
            we shall fill our houses with plunder;</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>throw in your lot among us;
            we will all have one purse”—
        </p>
        <p><b>15 </b>my son, do not walk in the way with them;
            hold back your foot from their paths,</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>for their feet run to evil,
            and they make haste to shed blood.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>For in vain is a net spread
            in the sight of any bird,</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>but these men lie in wait for their own blood;
            they set an ambush for their own lives.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain;
            it takes away the life of its possessors.</p>
            <h3>The Call of Wisdom</h3>
        <p><b>20 </b>Wisdom cries aloud in the street,
            in the markets she raises her voice;</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>at the head of the noisy streets she cries out;
            at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>“How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple?
            How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing
                and fools hate knowledge?
            </p>
        <p><b>23 </b>If you turn at my reproof,
            behold, I will pour out my spirit to you;
                I will make my words known to you.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>Because I have called and you refused to listen,
            have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>because you have ignored all my counsel
            and would have none of my reproof,</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>I also will laugh at your calamity;
            I will mock when terror strikes you,</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>when terror strikes you like a storm
            and your calamity comes like a whirlwind,
            when distress and anguish come upon you.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer;
            they will seek me diligently but will not find me.</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>Because they hated knowledge
            and did not choose the fear of the Lord,</p>
        <p><b>30 </b>would have none of my counsel
            and despised all my reproof,</p>
        <p><b>31 </b>therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way,
            and have their fill of their own devices.
        </p>
        <p><b>32 </b>For the simple are killed by their turning away,
            and the complacency of fools destroys them;</p>
        <p><b>33 </b>but whoever listens to me will dwell secure
            and will be at ease, without dread of disaster.”</p>
