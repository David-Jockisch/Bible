        <h3>Practical Warnings</h3>
        <p><b>1 </b>My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor,
            have given your pledge for a stranger,</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>if you are snared in the words of your mouth,
            caught in the words of your mouth,</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>then do this, my son, and save yourself,
            for you have come into the hand of your neighbor:
            go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>Give your eyes no sleep
            and your eyelids no slumber;</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
            like a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Go to the ant, O sluggard;
            consider her ways, and be wise.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>Without having any chief,
            officer, or ruler,</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>she prepares her bread in summer
            and gathers her food in harvest.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>How long will you lie there, O sluggard?
            When will you arise from your sleep?</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>A little sleep, a little slumber,
            a little folding of the hands to rest,</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>and poverty will come upon you like a robber,
            and want like an armed man.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>A worthless person, a wicked man,
            goes about with crooked speech,</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>winks with his eyes, signals with his feet,
            points with his finger,</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>with perverted heart devises evil,
            continually sowing discord;</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly;
            in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>There are six things that the Lord hates,
            seven that are an abomination to him:</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
            and hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>a heart that devises wicked plans,
            feet that make haste to run to evil,</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>a false witness who breathes out lies,
            and one who sows discord among brothers.</p>
        <h3>Warnings Against Adultery</h3>
        <p><b>20 </b>My son, keep your father's commandment,
            and forsake not your mother's teaching.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>Bind them on your heart always;
            tie them around your neck.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>When you walk, they will lead you;
            when you lie down, they will watch over you;
            and when you awake, they will talk with you.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light,
            and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>to preserve you from the evil woman,
            from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>Do not desire her beauty in your heart,
            and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes;</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread,
            but a married woman hunts down a precious life.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>Can a man carry fire next to his chest
            and his clothes not be burned?</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>Or can one walk on hot coals
            and his feet not be scorched?</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife;
            none who touches her will go unpunished.</p>
        <p><b>30 </b>People do not despise a thief if he steals
            to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry,</p>
        <p><b>31 </b>but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold;
            he will give all the goods of his house.</p>
        <p><b>32 </b>He who commits adultery lacks sense;
            he who does it destroys himself.</p>
        <p><b>33 </b>He will get wounds and dishonor,
            and his disgrace will not be wiped away.</p>
        <p><b>34 </b>For jealousy makes a man furious,
            and he will not spare when he takes revenge.</p>
        <p><b>35 </b>He will accept no compensation;
            he will refuse though you multiply gifts.</p>
