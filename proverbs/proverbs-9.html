        <h3>The Way of Wisdom</h3>
        <p><b>1 </b>Wisdom has built her house;
            she has hewn her seven pillars.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>She has slaughtered her beasts; she has mixed her wine;
            she has also set her table.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>She has sent out her young women to call
            from the highest places in the town,</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
            To him who lacks sense she says,</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>“Come, eat of my bread
            and drink of the wine I have mixed.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Leave your simple ways, and live,
            and walk in the way of insight.”</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse,
            and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you;
            reprove a wise man, and he will love you.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser;
            teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
            and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>For by me your days will be multiplied,
            and years will be added to your life.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>If you are wise, you are wise for yourself;
            if you scoff, you alone will bear it.</p>
        <h3>The Way of Folly</h3>
        <p><b>13 </b>The woman Folly is loud;
            she is seductive and knows nothing.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>She sits at the door of her house;
            she takes a seat on the highest places of the town,</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>calling to those who pass by,
            who are going straight on their way,</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
            And to him who lacks sense she says,</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>“Stolen water is sweet,
            and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.”</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>But he does not know that the dead are there,
            that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.</p>
