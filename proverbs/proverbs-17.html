        <h1>Proverbs 17</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>Better is a dry morsel with quiet
            than a house full of feasting with strife.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who acts shamefully
            and will share the inheritance as one of the brothers.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold,
            and the Lord tests hearts.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>An evildoer listens to wicked lips,
            and a liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>Whoever mocks the poor insults his Maker;
            he who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Grandchildren are the crown of the aged,
            and the glory of children is their fathers.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>Fine speech is not becoming to a fool;
            still less is false speech to a prince.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>A bribe is like a magic stone in the eyes of the one who gives it;
            wherever he turns he prospers.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Whoever covers an offense seeks love,
            but he who repeats a matter separates close friends.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>A rebuke goes deeper into a man of understanding
            than a hundred blows into a fool.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>An evil man seeks only rebellion,
            and a cruel messenger will be sent against him.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>Let a man meet a she-bear robbed of her cubs
            rather than a fool in his folly.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>If anyone returns evil for good,
            evil will not depart from his house.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>The beginning of strife is like letting out water,
            so quit before the quarrel breaks out.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous
            are both alike an abomination to the Lord.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>Why should a fool have money in his hand to buy wisdom
            when he has no sense?</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>A friend loves at all times,
            and a brother is born for adversity.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>One who lacks sense gives a pledge
            and puts up security in the presence of his neighbor.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>Whoever loves transgression loves strife;
            he who makes his door high seeks destruction.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>A man of crooked heart does not discover good,
            and one with a dishonest tongue falls into calamity.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>He who sires a fool gets himself sorrow,
            and the father of a fool has no joy.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>A joyful heart is good medicine,
            but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>The wicked accepts a bribe in secret
            to pervert the ways of justice.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>The discerning sets his face toward wisdom,
            but the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>A foolish son is a grief to his father
            and bitterness to her who bore him.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>To impose a fine on a righteous man is not good,
            nor to strike the noble for their uprightness.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>Whoever restrains his words has knowledge,
            and he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise;
            when he closes his lips, he is deemed intelligent.</p>
