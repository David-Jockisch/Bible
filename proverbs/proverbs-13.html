        <h1>Proverbs 13</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>A wise son hears his father's instruction,
            but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>From the fruit of his mouth a man eats what is good,
            but the desire of the treacherous is for violence.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>Whoever guards his mouth preserves his life;
            he who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing,
            while the soul of the diligent is richly supplied.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>The righteous hates falsehood,
            but the wicked brings shame and disgrace.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Righteousness guards him whose way is blameless,
            but sin overthrows the wicked.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>One pretends to be rich, yet has nothing;
            another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>The ransom of a man's life is his wealth,
            but a poor man hears no threat.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>The light of the righteous rejoices,
            but the lamp of the wicked will be put out.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>By insolence comes nothing but strife,
            but with those who take advice is wisdom.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>Wealth gained hastily will dwindle,
            but whoever gathers little by little will increase it.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>Hope deferred makes the heart sick,
            but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>Whoever despises the word brings destruction on himself,
            but he who reveres the commandment will be rewarded.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life,
            that one may turn away from the snares of death.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>Good sense wins favor,
            but the way of the treacherous is their ruin.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>Every prudent man acts with knowledge,
            but a fool flaunts his folly.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>A wicked messenger falls into trouble,
            but a faithful envoy brings healing.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>Poverty and disgrace come to him who ignores instruction,
            but whoever heeds reproof is honored.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>A desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul,
            but to turn away from evil is an abomination to fools.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise,
            but the companion of fools will suffer harm.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>Disaster pursues sinners,
            but the righteous are rewarded with good.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children,
            but the sinner's wealth is laid up for the righteous.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>The fallow ground of the poor would yield much food,
            but it is swept away through injustice.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>Whoever spares the rod hates his son,
            but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite,
            but the belly of the wicked suffers want.</p>
