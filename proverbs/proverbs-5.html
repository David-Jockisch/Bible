        <h3>Warning Against Adultery</h3>
        <p><b>1 </b>My son, be attentive to my wisdom;
            incline your ear to my understanding,</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>that you may keep discretion,
            and your lips may guard knowledge.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey,
            and her speech is smoother than oil,</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>but in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
            sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>Her feet go down to death;
            her steps follow the path to Sheol;</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>she does not ponder the path of life;
            her ways wander, and she does not know it.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>And now, O sons, listen to me,
            and do not depart from the words of my mouth.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>Keep your way far from her,
            and do not go near the door of her house,</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>lest you give your honor to others
            and your years to the merciless,</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>lest strangers take their fill of your strength,
            and your labors go to the house of a foreigner,</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>and at the end of your life you groan,
            when your flesh and body are consumed,</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>and you say, “How I hated discipline,
            and my heart despised reproof!</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>I did not listen to the voice of my teachers
            or incline my ear to my instructors.
        </p>
        <p><b>14 </b>I am at the brink of utter ruin
            in the assembled congregation.”</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>Drink water from your own cistern,
            flowing water from your own well.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>Should your springs be scattered abroad,
            streams of water in the streets?</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>Let them be for yourself alone,
            and not for strangers with you.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>Let your fountain be blessed,
            and rejoice in the wife of your youth,</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>a lovely deer, a graceful doe.
            Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight;
                be intoxicated always in her love.
            </p>
        <p><b>20 </b>Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman
            and embrace the bosom of an adulteress?</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>For a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord,
            and he ponders all his paths.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him,
            and he is held fast in the cords of his sin.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>He dies for lack of discipline,
            and because of his great folly he is led astray.</p>
