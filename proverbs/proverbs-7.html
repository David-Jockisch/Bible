        <h3>Warning Against the Adulteress</h3>
        <p><b>1 </b>My son, keep my words
            and treasure up my commandments with you;</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>keep my commandments and live;
            keep my teaching as the apple of your eye;</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>bind them on your fingers;
            write them on the tablet of your heart.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
            and call insight your intimate friend,</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>to keep you from the forbidden woman,
            from the adulteress with her smooth words.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>For at the window of my house
            I have looked out through my lattice,</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>and I have seen among the simple,
            I have perceived among the youths,
            a young man lacking sense,</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>passing along the street near her corner,
            taking the road to her house</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>in the twilight, in the evening,
            at the time of night and darkness.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>And behold, the woman meets him,
            dressed as a prostitute, wily of heart.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>She is loud and wayward;
            her feet do not stay at home;</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>now in the street, now in the market,
            and at every corner she lies in wait.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>She seizes him and kisses him,
            and with bold face she says to him,</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>“I had to offer sacrifices,
            and today I have paid my vows;</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>so now I have come out to meet you,
            to seek you eagerly, and I have found you.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>I have spread my couch with coverings,
            colored linens from Egyptian linen;</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>I have perfumed my bed with myrrh,
            aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>Come, let us take our fill of love till morning;
            let us delight ourselves with love.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>For my husband is not at home;
            he has gone on a long journey;</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>he took a bag of money with him;
            at full moon he will come home.”</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>With much seductive speech she persuades him;
            with her smooth talk she compels him.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>All at once he follows her,
            as an ox goes to the slaughter,
        or as a stag is caught fast</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>till an arrow pierces its liver;
            as a bird rushes into a snare;
                he does not know that it will cost him his life.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>And now, O sons, listen to me,
            and be attentive to the words of my mouth.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>Let not your heart turn aside to her ways;
            do not stray into her paths,</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>for many a victim has she laid low,
            and all her slain are a mighty throng.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>Her house is the way to Sheol,
            going down to the chambers of death.</p>
