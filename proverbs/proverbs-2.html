        <h3>The Value of Wisdom</h3>
        <p><b>1 </b>My son, if you receive my words
            and treasure up my commandments with you,</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>making your ear attentive to wisdom
            and inclining your heart to understanding;</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>yes, if you call out for insight
            and raise your voice for understanding,</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>if you seek it like silver
            and search for it as for hidden treasures,</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>then you will understand the fear of the Lord
            and find the knowledge of God.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>For the Lord gives wisdom;
            from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>he stores up sound wisdom for the upright;
            he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>guarding the paths of justice
            and watching over the way of his saints.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Then you will understand righteousness and justice
            and equity, every good path;</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>for wisdom will come into your heart,
            and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>discretion will watch over you,
            understanding will guard you,</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>delivering you from the way of evil,
            from men of perverted speech,</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>who forsake the paths of uprightness
            to walk in the ways of darkness,</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>who rejoice in doing evil
            and delight in the perverseness of evil,</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>men whose paths are crooked,
            and who are devious in their ways.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman,
            from the adulteress with her smooth words,</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>who forsakes the companion of her youth
            and forgets the covenant of her God;</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>for her house sinks down to death,
            and her paths to the departed;</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>none who go to her come back,
            nor do they regain the paths of life.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>So you will walk in the way of the good
            and keep to the paths of the righteous.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>For the upright will inhabit the land,
            and those with integrity will remain in it,</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>but the wicked will be cut off from the land,
            and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.</p>
