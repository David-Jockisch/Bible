        <h1>Proverbs 28</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>The wicked flee when no one pursues,
            but the righteous are bold as a lion.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>When a land transgresses, it has many rulers,
            but with a man of understanding and knowledge,
            its stability will long continue.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>A poor man who oppresses the poor
            is a beating rain that leaves no food.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,
            but those who keep the law strive against them.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>Evil men do not understand justice,
            but those who seek the Lord understand it completely.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity
            than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>The one who keeps the law is a son with understanding,
            but a companion of gluttons shames his father.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>Whoever multiplies his wealth by interest and profit
            gathers it for him who is generous to the poor.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>If one turns away his ear from hearing the law,
            even his prayer is an abomination.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>Whoever misleads the upright into an evil way
            will fall into his own pit,
            but the blameless will have a goodly inheritance.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>A rich man is wise in his own eyes,
            but a poor man who has understanding will find him out.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>When the righteous triumph, there is great glory,
            but when the wicked rise, people hide themselves.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
            but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>Blessed is the one who fears the Lord always,
            but whoever hardens his heart will fall into calamity.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>Like a roaring lion or a charging bear
            is a wicked ruler over a poor people.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>A ruler who lacks understanding is a cruel oppressor,
            but he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>If one is burdened with the blood of another,
            he will be a fugitive until death;
            let no one help him.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>Whoever walks in integrity will be delivered,
            but he who is crooked in his ways will suddenly fall.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread,
            but he who follows worthless pursuits will have plenty of poverty.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>A faithful man will abound with blessings,
            but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>To show partiality is not good,
            but for a piece of bread a man will do wrong.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>A stingy man hastens after wealth
            and does not know that poverty will come upon him.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>Whoever rebukes a man will afterward find more favor
            than he who flatters with his tongue.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>Whoever robs his father or his mother
            and says, “That is no transgression,”
            is a companion to a man who destroys.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>A greedy man stirs up strife,
            but the one who trusts in the Lord will be enriched.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>Whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool,
            but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>Whoever gives to the poor will not want,
            but he who hides his eyes will get many a curse.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>When the wicked rise, people hide themselves,
            but when they perish, the righteous increase.</p>
