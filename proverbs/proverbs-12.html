        <h1>Proverbs 12</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,
            but he who hates reproof is stupid.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>A good man obtains favor from the Lord,
            but a man of evil devices he condemns.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>No one is established by wickedness,
            but the root of the righteous will never be moved.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>An excellent wife is the crown of her husband,
            but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>The thoughts of the righteous are just;
            the counsels of the wicked are deceitful.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood,
            but the mouth of the upright delivers them.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>The wicked are overthrown and are no more,
            but the house of the righteous will stand.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>A man is commended according to his good sense,
            but one of twisted mind is despised.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Better to be lowly and have a servant
            than to play the great man and lack bread.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>Whoever is righteous has regard for the life of his beast,
            but the mercy of the wicked is cruel.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread,
            but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>Whoever is wicked covets the spoil of evildoers,
            but the root of the righteous bears fruit.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>An evil man is ensnared by the transgression of his lips,
            but the righteous escapes from trouble.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>From the fruit of his mouth a man is satisfied with good,
            and the work of a man's hand comes back to him.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,
            but a wise man listens to advice.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>The vexation of a fool is known at once,
            but the prudent ignores an insult.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>Whoever speaks the truth gives honest evidence,
            but a false witness utters deceit.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts,
            but the tongue of the wise brings healing.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>Truthful lips endure forever,
            but a lying tongue is but for a moment.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil,
            but those who plan peace have joy.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>No ill befalls the righteous,
            but the wicked are filled with trouble.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord,
            but those who act faithfully are his delight.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>A prudent man conceals knowledge,
            but the heart of fools proclaims folly.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>The hand of the diligent will rule,
            while the slothful will be put to forced labor.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>Anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down,
            but a good word makes him glad.
        </p>
        <p><b>26 </b>One who is righteous is a guide to his neighbor,
            but the way of the wicked leads them astray.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>Whoever is slothful will not roast his game,
            but the diligent man will get precious wealth.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>In the path of righteousness is life,
            and in its pathway there is no death.</p>
