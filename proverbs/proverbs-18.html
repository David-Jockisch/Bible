        <h1>Proverbs 18</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>Whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire;
            he breaks out against all sound judgment.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>A fool takes no pleasure in understanding,
            but only in expressing his opinion.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>When wickedness comes, contempt comes also,
            and with dishonor comes disgrace.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>The words of a man's mouth are deep waters;
            the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>It is not good to be partial to the wicked
            or to deprive the righteous of justice.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>A fool's lips walk into a fight,
            and his mouth invites a beating.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>A fool's mouth is his ruin,
            and his lips are a snare to his soul.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels;
            they go down into the inner parts of the body.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Whoever is slack in his work
            is a brother to him who destroys.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>The name of the Lord is a strong tower;
            the righteous man runs into it and is safe.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>A rich man's wealth is his strong city,
            and like a high wall in his imagination.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>Before destruction a man's heart is haughty,
            but humility comes before honor.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>If one gives an answer before he hears,
            it is his folly and shame.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>A man's spirit will endure sickness,
            but a crushed spirit who can bear?</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>An intelligent heart acquires knowledge,
            and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>A man's gift makes room for him
            and brings him before the great.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>The one who states his case first seems right,
            until the other comes and examines him.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>The lot puts an end to quarrels
            and decides between powerful contenders.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>A brother offended is more unyielding than a strong city,
            and quarreling is like the bars of a castle.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>From the fruit of a man's mouth his stomach is satisfied;
            he is satisfied by the yield of his lips.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>Death and life are in the power of the tongue,
            and those who love it will eat its fruits.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>He who finds a wife finds a good thing
            and obtains favor from the Lord.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>The poor use entreaties,
            but the rich answer roughly.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>A man of many companions may come to ruin,
            but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.</p>
