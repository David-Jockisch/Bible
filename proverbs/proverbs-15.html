        <h1>Proverbs 15</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>A soft answer turns away wrath,
            but a harsh word stirs up anger.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>The tongue of the wise commends knowledge,
            but the mouths of fools pour out folly.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>The eyes of the Lord are in every place,
            keeping watch on the evil and the good.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>A gentle tongue is a tree of life,
            but perverseness in it breaks the spirit.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>A fool despises his father's instruction,
            but whoever heeds reproof is prudent.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>In the house of the righteous there is much treasure,
            but trouble befalls the income of the wicked.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>The lips of the wise spread knowledge;
            not so the hearts of fools.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,
            but the prayer of the upright is acceptable to him.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,
            but he loves him who pursues righteousness.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>There is severe discipline for him who forsakes the way;
            whoever hates reproof will die.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the Lord;
            how much more the hearts of the children of man!</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>A scoffer does not like to be reproved;
            he will not go to the wise.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>A glad heart makes a cheerful face,
            but by sorrow of heart the spirit is crushed.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge,
            but the mouths of fools feed on folly.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>All the days of the afflicted are evil,
            but the cheerful of heart has a continual feast.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>Better is a little with the fear of the Lord
            than great treasure and trouble with it.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>Better is a dinner of herbs where love is
            than a fattened ox and hatred with it.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>A hot-tempered man stirs up strife,
            but he who is slow to anger quiets contention.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>The way of a sluggard is like a hedge of thorns,
            but the path of the upright is a level highway.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>A wise son makes a glad father,
            but a foolish man despises his mother.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>Folly is a joy to him who lacks sense,
            but a man of understanding walks straight ahead.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>Without counsel plans fail,
            but with many advisers they succeed.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>To make an apt answer is a joy to a man,
            and a word in season, how good it is!</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>The path of life leads upward for the prudent,
            that he may turn away from Sheol beneath.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>The Lord tears down the house of the proud
            but maintains the widow's boundaries.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord,
            but gracious words are pure.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>Whoever is greedy for unjust gain troubles his own household,
            but he who hates bribes will live.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer,
            but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>The Lord is far from the wicked,
            but he hears the prayer of the righteous.</p>
        <p><b>30 </b>The light of the eyes rejoices the heart,
            and good news refreshes the bones.</p>
        <p><b>31 </b>The ear that listens to life-giving reproof
            will dwell among the wise.</p>
        <p><b>32 </b>Whoever ignores instruction despises himself,
            but he who listens to reproof gains intelligence.</p>
        <p><b>33 </b>The fear of the Lord is instruction in wisdom,
            and humility comes before honor.</p>
