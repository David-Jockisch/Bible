        <h1>Proverbs 18</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity
            than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>Desire without knowledge is not good,
            and whoever makes haste with his feet misses his way.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>When a man's folly brings his way to ruin,
            his heart rages against the Lord.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>Wealth brings many new friends,
            but a poor man is deserted by his friend.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>A false witness will not go unpunished,
            and he who breathes out lies will not escape.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Many seek the favor of a generous man,
            and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>All a poor man's brothers hate him;
            how much more do his friends go far from him!
        He pursues them with words, but does not have them.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>Whoever gets sense loves his own soul;
            he who keeps understanding will discover good.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>A false witness will not go unpunished,
            and he who breathes out lies will perish.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury,
            much less for a slave to rule over princes.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>Good sense makes one slow to anger,
            and it is his glory to overlook an offense.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>A king's wrath is like the growling of a lion,
            but his favor is like dew on the grass.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>A foolish son is ruin to his father,
            and a wife's quarreling is a continual dripping of rain.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>House and wealth are inherited from fathers,
            but a prudent wife is from the Lord.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep,
            and an idle person will suffer hunger.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>Whoever keeps the commandment keeps his life;
            he who despises his ways will die.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord,
            and he will repay him for his deed.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>Discipline your son, for there is hope;
            do not set your heart on putting him to death.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>A man of great wrath will pay the penalty,
            for if you deliver him, you will only have to do it again.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>Listen to advice and accept instruction,
            that you may gain wisdom in the future.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>Many are the plans in the mind of a man,
            but it is the purpose of the Lord that will stand.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>What is desired in a man is steadfast love,
            and a poor man is better than a liar.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>The fear of the Lord leads to life,
            and whoever has it rests satisfied;
            he will not be visited by harm.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>The sluggard buries his hand in the dish
            and will not even bring it back to his mouth.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>Strike a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;
            reprove a man of understanding, and he will gain knowledge.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>He who does violence to his father and chases away his mother
            is a son who brings shame and reproach.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>Cease to hear instruction, my son,
            and you will stray from the words of knowledge.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>A worthless witness mocks at justice,
            and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>Condemnation is ready for scoffers,
            and beating for the backs of fools.</p>
