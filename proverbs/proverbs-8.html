        <h3>The Blessings of Wisdom</h3>
        <p><b>1 </b>Does not wisdom call?
            Does not understanding raise her voice?</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>On the heights beside the way,
            at the crossroads she takes her stand;</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>beside the gates in front of the town,
            at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud:</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>“To you, O men, I call,
            and my cry is to the children of man.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>O simple ones, learn prudence;
            O fools, learn sense.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Hear, for I will speak noble things,
            and from my lips will come what is right,</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>for my mouth will utter truth;
            wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>All the words of my mouth are righteous;
            there is nothing twisted or crooked in them.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>They are all straight to him who understands,
            and right to those who find knowledge.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>Take my instruction instead of silver,
            and knowledge rather than choice gold,</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>for wisdom is better than jewels,
            and all that you may desire cannot compare with her.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>“I, wisdom, dwell with prudence,
            and I find knowledge and discretion.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil.
            Pride and arrogance and the way of evil
                and perverted speech I hate.
            </p>
        <p><b>14 </b>I have counsel and sound wisdom;
            I have insight; I have strength.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>By me kings reign,
            and rulers decree what is just;</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>by me princes rule,
            and nobles, all who govern justly.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>I love those who love me,
            and those who seek me diligently find me.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>Riches and honor are with me,
            enduring wealth and righteousness.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold,
            and my yield than choice silver.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>I walk in the way of righteousness,
            in the paths of justice,</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>granting an inheritance to those who love me,
            and filling their treasuries.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>“The Lord possessed me at the beginning of his work,
            the first of his acts of old.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>Ages ago I was set up,
            at the first, before the beginning of the earth.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>When there were no depths I was brought forth,
            when there were no springs abounding with water.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>Before the mountains had been shaped,
            before the hills, I was brought forth,</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>before he had made the earth with its fields,
            or the first of the dust of the world.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>When he established the heavens, I was there;
            when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>when he made firm the skies above,
            when he established the fountains of the deep,</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>when he assigned to the sea its limit,
            so that the waters might not transgress his command,
        when he marked out the foundations of the earth,</p>
        <p><b>30 </b>then I was beside him, like a master workman,
            and I was daily his delight,
                rejoicing before him always,</p>
        <p><b>31 </b>rejoicing in his inhabited world
            and delighting in the children of man.</p>
        <p><b>32 </b>“And now, O sons, listen to me:
            blessed are those who keep my ways.</p>
        <p><b>33 </b>Hear instruction and be wise,
            and do not neglect it.</p>
        <p><b>34 </b>Blessed is the one who listens to me,
            watching daily at my gates,
            waiting beside my doors.</p>
        <p><b>35 </b>For whoever finds me finds life
            and obtains favor from the Lord,</p>
        <p><b>36 </b>but he who fails to find me injures himself;
            all who hate me love death.”</p>
