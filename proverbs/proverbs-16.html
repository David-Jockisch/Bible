        <h1>Proverbs 16</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>The plans of the heart belong to man,
            but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord.
        </p>
        <p><b>2 </b>All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes,
            but the Lord weighs the spirit.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>Commit your work to the Lord,
            and your plans will be established.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>The Lord has made everything for its purpose,
            even the wicked for the day of trouble.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>Everyone who is arrogant in heart is an abomination to the Lord;
            be assured, he will not go unpunished.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>By steadfast love and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for,
            and by the fear of the Lord one turns away from evil.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>When a man's ways please the Lord,
            he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>Better is a little with righteousness
            than great revenues with injustice.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>The heart of man plans his way,
            but the Lord establishes his steps.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>An oracle is on the lips of a king;
            his mouth does not sin in judgment.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>A just balance and scales are the Lord's;
            all the weights in the bag are his work.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>It is an abomination to kings to do evil,
            for the throne is established by righteousness.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>Righteous lips are the delight of a king,
            and he loves him who speaks what is right.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>A king's wrath is a messenger of death,
            and a wise man will appease it.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>In the light of a king's face there is life,
            and his favor is like the clouds that bring the spring rain.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>How much better to get wisdom than gold!
            To get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>The highway of the upright turns aside from evil;
            whoever guards his way preserves his life.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>Pride goes before destruction,
            and a haughty spirit before a fall.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor
            than to divide the spoil with the proud.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>Whoever gives thought to the word will discover good,
            and blessed is he who trusts in the Lord.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>The wise of heart is called discerning,
            and sweetness of speech increases persuasiveness.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>Good sense is a fountain of life to him who has it,
            but the instruction of fools is folly.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>The heart of the wise makes his speech judicious
            and adds persuasiveness to his lips.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>Gracious words are like a honeycomb,
            sweetness to the soul and health to the body.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>There is a way that seems right to a man,
            but its end is the way to death.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>A worker's appetite works for him;
            his mouth urges him on.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>A worthless man plots evil,
            and his speech is like a scorching fire.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>A dishonest man spreads strife,
            and a whisperer separates close friends.</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>A man of violence entices his neighbor
            and leads him in a way that is not good.</p>
        <p><b>30 </b>Whoever winks his eyes plans dishonest things;
            he who purses his lips brings evil to pass.</p>
        <p><b>31 </b>Gray hair is a crown of glory;
            it is gained in a righteous life.</p>
        <p><b>32 </b>Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty,
            and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.</p>
        <p><b>33 </b>The lot is cast into the lap,
            but its every decision is from the Lord.</p>
