        <h1>Proverbs 11</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>A false balance is an abomination to the Lord,
            but a just weight is his delight.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>When pride comes, then comes disgrace,
            but with the humble is wisdom.
        </p>
        <p><b>3 </b>The integrity of the upright guides them,
            but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>Riches do not profit in the day of wrath,
            but righteousness delivers from death.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>The righteousness of the blameless keeps his way straight,
            but the wicked falls by his own wickedness.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>The righteousness of the upright delivers them,
            but the treacherous are taken captive by their lust.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>When the wicked dies, his hope will perish,
            and the expectation of wealth perishes too.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>The righteous is delivered from trouble,
            and the wicked walks into it instead.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>With his mouth the godless man would destroy his neighbor,
            but by knowledge the righteous are delivered.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices,
            and when the wicked perish there are shouts of gladness.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted,
            but by the mouth of the wicked it is overthrown.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>Whoever belittles his neighbor lacks sense,
            but a man of understanding remains silent.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets,
            but he who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a thing covered.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>Where there is no guidance, a people falls,
            but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>Whoever puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer harm,
            but he who hates striking hands in pledge is secure.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>A gracious woman gets honor,
            and violent men get riches.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>A man who is kind benefits himself,
            but a cruel man hurts himself.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>The wicked earns deceptive wages,
            but one who sows righteousness gets a sure reward.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>Whoever is steadfast in righteousness will live,
            but he who pursues evil will die.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>Those of crooked heart are an abomination to the Lord,
            but those of blameless ways are his delight.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>Be assured, an evil person will not go unpunished,
            but the offspring of the righteous will be delivered.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>Like a gold ring in a pig's snout
            is a beautiful woman without discretion.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>The desire of the righteous ends only in good,
            the expectation of the wicked in wrath.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>One gives freely, yet grows all the richer;
            another withholds what he should give, and only suffers want.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>Whoever brings blessing will be enriched,
            and one who waters will himself be watered.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>The people curse him who holds back grain,
            but a blessing is on the head of him who sells it.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>Whoever diligently seeks good seeks favor,
            but evil comes to him who searches for it.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>Whoever trusts in his riches will fall,
            but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf.</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>Whoever troubles his own household will inherit the wind,
            and the fool will be servant to the wise of heart.</p>
        <p><b>30 </b>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life,
            and whoever captures souls is wise.</p>
        <p><b>31 </b>If the righteous is repaid on earth,
            how much more the wicked and the sinner!</p>
