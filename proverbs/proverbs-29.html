        <h1>Proverbs 29</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>He who is often reproved, yet stiffens his neck,
            will suddenly be broken beyond healing.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>When the righteous increase, the people rejoice,
            but when the wicked rule, the people groan.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>He who loves wisdom makes his father glad,
            but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>By justice a king builds up the land,
            but he who exacts gifts tears it down.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>A man who flatters his neighbor
            spreads a net for his feet.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>An evil man is ensnared in his transgression,
            but a righteous man sings and rejoices.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>A righteous man knows the rights of the poor;
            a wicked man does not understand such knowledge.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>Scoffers set a city aflame,
            but the wise turn away wrath.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>If a wise man has an argument with a fool,
            the fool only rages and laughs, and there is no quiet.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>Bloodthirsty men hate one who is blameless
            and seek the life of the upright.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>A fool gives full vent to his spirit,
            but a wise man quietly holds it back.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>If a ruler listens to falsehood,
            all his officials will be wicked.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>The poor man and the oppressor meet together;
            the Lord gives light to the eyes of both.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>If a king faithfully judges the poor,
            his throne will be established forever.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>The rod and reproof give wisdom,
            but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>When the wicked increase, transgression increases,
            but the righteous will look upon their downfall.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>Discipline your son, and he will give you rest;
            he will give delight to your heart.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>Where there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint,
            but blessed is he who keeps the law.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>By mere words a servant is not disciplined,
            for though he understands, he will not respond.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?
            There is more hope for a fool than for him.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>Whoever pampers his servant from childhood
            will in the end find him his heir.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>A man of wrath stirs up strife,
            and one given to anger causes much transgression.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>One's pride will bring him low,
            but he who is lowly in spirit will obtain honor.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>The partner of a thief hates his own life;
            he hears the curse, but discloses nothing.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>The fear of man lays a snare,
            but whoever trusts in the Lord is safe.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>Many seek the face of a ruler,
            but it is from the Lord that a man gets justice.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous,
            but one whose way is straight is an abomination to the wicked.</p>
