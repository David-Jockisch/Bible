        <h1>Proverbs 3</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Trust in the Lord with All Your Heart</h3>
        <p><b>1 </b>My son, do not forget my teaching,
            but let your heart keep my commandments,</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>for length of days and years of life
            and peace they will add to you.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you;
            bind them around your neck;
            write them on the tablet of your heart.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>So you will find favor and good success
            in the sight of God and man.
        </p>
        <p><b>5 </b>Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
            and do not lean on your own understanding.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>In all your ways acknowledge him,
            and he will make straight your paths.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>Be not wise in your own eyes;
            fear the Lord, and turn away from evil.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>It will be healing to your flesh
            and refreshment to your bones.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Honor the Lord with your wealth
            and with the firstfruits of all your produce;</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>then your barns will be filled with plenty,
            and your vats will be bursting with wine.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline
            or be weary of his reproof,
        </p>
        <p><b>12 </b>for the Lord reproves him whom he loves,
            as a father the son in whom he delights.</p>
        <h3>Blessed Is the One Who Finds Wisdom</h3>
        <p><b>13 </b>Blessed is the one who finds wisdom,
            and the one who gets understanding,</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>for the gain from her is better than gain from silver
            and her profit better than gold.
        </p>
        <p><b>15 </b>She is more precious than jewels,
            and nothing you desire can compare with her.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>Long life is in her right hand;
            in her left hand are riches and honor.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
            and all her paths are peace.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her;
            those who hold her fast are called blessed.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>The Lord by wisdom founded the earth;
            by understanding he established the heavens;</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>by his knowledge the deeps broke open,
            and the clouds drop down the dew.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>My son, do not lose sight of these—
            keep sound wisdom and discretion,</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>and they will be life for your soul
            and adornment for your neck.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>Then you will walk on your way securely,
            and your foot will not stumble.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>If you lie down, you will not be afraid;
            when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>Do not be afraid of sudden terror
            or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes,</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>for the Lord will be your confidence
            and will keep your foot from being caught.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,
            when it is in your power to do it.
        </p>
        <p><b>28 </b>Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again,
            tomorrow I will give it”—when you have it with you.</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>Do not plan evil against your neighbor,
            who dwells trustingly beside you.</p>
        <p><b>30 </b>Do not contend with a man for no reason,
            when he has done you no harm.</p>
        <p><b>31 </b>Do not envy a man of violence
            and do not choose any of his ways,</p>
        <p><b>32 </b>for the devious person is an abomination to the Lord,
            but the upright are in his confidence.</p>
        <p><b>33 </b>The Lord's curse is on the house of the wicked,
            but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous.</p>
        <p><b>34 </b>Toward the scorners he is scornful,
            but to the humble he gives favor.</p>
        <p><b>35 </b>The wise will inherit honor,
            but fools get disgrace.</p>
