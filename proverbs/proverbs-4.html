        <div class="content-box">
        <h3>A Father's Wise Instruction</h3>
        <p><b>1 </b>Hear, O sons, a father's instruction,
            and be attentive, that you may gain insight,</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>for I give you good precepts;
            do not forsake my teaching.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>When I was a son with my father,
            tender, the only one in the sight of my mother,</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>he taught me and said to me,
            “Let your heart hold fast my words;
                keep my commandments, and live.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>Get wisdom; get insight;
            do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Do not forsake her, and she will keep you;
            love her, and she will guard you.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom,
            and whatever you get, get insight.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>Prize her highly, and she will exalt you;
            she will honor you if you embrace her.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>She will place on your head a graceful garland;
            she will bestow on you a beautiful crown.”</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>Hear, my son, and accept my words,
            that the years of your life may be many.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>I have taught you the way of wisdom;
            I have led you in the paths of uprightness.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>When you walk, your step will not be hampered,
            and if you run, you will not stumble.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>Keep hold of instruction; do not let go;
            guard her, for she is your life.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>Do not enter the path of the wicked,
            and do not walk in the way of the evil.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>Avoid it; do not go on it;
            turn away from it and pass on.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong;
            they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>For they eat the bread of wickedness
            and drink the wine of violence.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn,
            which shines brighter and brighter until full day.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>The way of the wicked is like deep darkness;
            they do not know over what they stumble.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>My son, be attentive to my words;
            incline your ear to my sayings.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>Let them not escape from your sight;
            keep them within your heart.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>For they are life to those who find them,
            and healing to all their flesh.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>Keep your heart with all vigilance,
            for from it flow the springs of life.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>Put away from you crooked speech,
            and put devious talk far from you.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>Let your eyes look directly forward,
            and your gaze be straight before you.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>Ponder the path of your feet;
            then all your ways will be sure.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>Do not swerve to the right or to the left;
            turn your foot away from evil.</p>
