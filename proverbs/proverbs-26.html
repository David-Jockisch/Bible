        <h1>Proverbs 26</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>Like snow in summer or rain in harvest,
            so honor is not fitting for a fool.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>Like a sparrow in its flitting, like a swallow in its flying,
            a curse that is causeless does not alight.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey,
            and a rod for the back of fools.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>Answer not a fool according to his folly,
            lest you be like him yourself.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>Answer a fool according to his folly,
            lest he be wise in his own eyes.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Whoever sends a message by the hand of a fool
            cuts off his own feet and drinks violence.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>Like a lame man's legs, which hang useless,
            is a proverb in the mouth of fools.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>Like one who binds the stone in the sling
            is one who gives honor to a fool.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard
            is a proverb in the mouth of fools.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>Like an archer who wounds everyone
            is one who hires a passing fool or drunkard.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>Like a dog that returns to his vomit
            is a fool who repeats his folly.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes?
            There is more hope for a fool than for him.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!
            There is a lion in the streets!”</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>As a door turns on its hinges,
            so does a sluggard on his bed.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
            it wears him out to bring it back to his mouth.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes
            than seven men who can answer sensibly.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>Whoever meddles in a quarrel not his own
            is like one who takes a passing dog by the ears.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>Like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>is the man who deceives his neighbor
            and says, “I am only joking!”</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>For lack of wood the fire goes out,
            and where there is no whisperer, quarreling ceases.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>As charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire,
            so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels;
            they go down into the inner parts of the body.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>Like the glaze covering an earthen vessel
            are fervent lips with an evil heart.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>Whoever hates disguises himself with his lips
            and harbors deceit in his heart;</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>when he speaks graciously, believe him not,
            for there are seven abominations in his heart;</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>though his hatred be covered with deception,
            his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>Whoever digs a pit will fall into it,
            and a stone will come back on him who starts it rolling.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>A lying tongue hates its victims,
            and a flattering mouth works ruin.</p>
