        <h1>Proverbs 22</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches,
            and favor is better than silver or gold.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>The rich and the poor meet together;
            the Lord is the Maker of them all.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>The prudent sees danger and hides himself,
            but the simple go on and suffer for it.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>The reward for humility and fear of the Lord
            is riches and honor and life.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>Thorns and snares are in the way of the crooked;
            whoever guards his soul will keep far from them.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Train up a child in the way he should go;
            even when he is old he will not depart from it.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>The rich rules over the poor,
            and the borrower is the slave of the lender.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>Whoever sows injustice will reap calamity,
            and the rod of his fury will fail.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Whoever has a bountiful eye will be blessed,
            for he shares his bread with the poor.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>Drive out a scoffer, and strife will go out,
            and quarreling and abuse will cease.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>He who loves purity of heart,
            and whose speech is gracious, will have the king as his friend.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>The eyes of the Lord keep watch over knowledge,
            but he overthrows the words of the traitor.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside!
            I shall be killed in the streets!”</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>The mouth of forbidden women is a deep pit;
            he with whom the Lord is angry will fall into it.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,
            but the rod of discipline drives it far from him.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth,
            or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.</p>
        <h3>Words of the Wise</h3>
        <p><b>17 </b>Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise,
            and apply your heart to my knowledge,</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>for it will be pleasant if you keep them within you,
            if all of them are ready on your lips.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>That your trust may be in the Lord,
            I have made them known to you today, even to you.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>Have I not written for you thirty sayings
            of counsel and knowledge,</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>to make you know what is right and true,
            that you may give a true answer to those who sent you?</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>Do not rob the poor, because he is poor,
            or crush the afflicted at the gate,</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>for the Lord will plead their cause
            and rob of life those who rob them.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>Make no friendship with a man given to anger,
            nor go with a wrathful man,</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>lest you learn his ways
            and entangle yourself in a snare.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>Be not one of those who give pledges,
            who put up security for debts.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>If you have nothing with which to pay,
            why should your bed be taken from under you?</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>Do not move the ancient landmark
            that your fathers have set.</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>Do you see a man skillful in his work?
            He will stand before kings;
            he will not stand before obscure men.</p>
