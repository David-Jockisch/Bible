        <h1>Proverbs 27</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>Do not boast about tomorrow,
            for you do not know what a day may bring.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;
            a stranger, and not your own lips.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>A stone is heavy, and sand is weighty,
            but a fool's provocation is heavier than both.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>Wrath is cruel, anger is overwhelming,
            but who can stand before jealousy?</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>Better is open rebuke
            than hidden love.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Faithful are the wounds of a friend;
            profuse are the kisses of an enemy.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>One who is full loathes honey,
            but to one who is hungry everything bitter is sweet.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>Like a bird that strays from its nest
            is a man who strays from his home.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Oil and perfume make the heart glad,
            and the sweetness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>Do not forsake your friend and your father's friend,
            and do not go to your brother's house in the day of your calamity.
        Better is a neighbor who is near
            than a brother who is far away.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad,
            that I may answer him who reproaches me.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>The prudent sees danger and hides himself,
            but the simple go on and suffer for it.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>Take a man's garment when he has put up security for a stranger,
            and hold it in pledge when he puts up security for an adulteress.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>Whoever blesses his neighbor with a loud voice,
            rising early in the morning,
            will be counted as cursing.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>A continual dripping on a rainy day
            and a quarrelsome wife are alike;</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>to restrain her is to restrain the wind
            or to grasp oil in one's right hand.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>Iron sharpens iron,
            and one man sharpens another.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,
            and he who guards his master will be honored.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>As in water face reflects face,
            so the heart of man reflects the man.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied,
            and never satisfied are the eyes of man.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold,
            and a man is tested by his praise.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>Crush a fool in a mortar with a pestle
            along with crushed grain,
            yet his folly will not depart from him.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>Know well the condition of your flocks,
            and give attention to your herds,</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>for riches do not last forever;
            and does a crown endure to all generations?</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>When the grass is gone and the new growth appears
            and the vegetation of the mountains is gathered,</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>the lambs will provide your clothing,
            and the goats the price of a field.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>There will be enough goats' milk for your food,
            for the food of your household
            and maintenance for your girls.</p>
