        <h1>Proverbs 14</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>The wisest of women builds her house,
            but folly with her own hands tears it down.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>Whoever walks in uprightness fears the Lord,
            but he who is devious in his ways despises him.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>By the mouth of a fool comes a rod for his back,
            but the lips of the wise will preserve them.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>Where there are no oxen, the manger is clean,
            but abundant crops come by the strength of the ox.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>A faithful witness does not lie,
            but a false witness breathes out lies.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>A scoffer seeks wisdom in vain,
            but knowledge is easy for a man of understanding.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>Leave the presence of a fool,
            for there you do not meet words of knowledge.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>The wisdom of the prudent is to discern his way,
            but the folly of fools is deceiving.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Fools mock at the guilt offering,
            but the upright enjoy acceptance.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>The heart knows its own bitterness,
            and no stranger shares its joy.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>The house of the wicked will be destroyed,
            but the tent of the upright will flourish.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>There is a way that seems right to a man,
            but its end is the way to death.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>Even in laughter the heart may ache,
            and the end of joy may be grief.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>The backslider in heart will be filled with the fruit of his ways,
            and a good man will be filled with the fruit of his ways.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>The simple believes everything,
            but the prudent gives thought to his steps.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>One who is wise is cautious and turns away from evil,
            but a fool is reckless and careless.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>A man of quick temper acts foolishly,
            and a man of evil devices is hated.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>The simple inherit folly,
            but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>The evil bow down before the good,
            the wicked at the gates of the righteous.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>The poor is disliked even by his neighbor,
            but the rich has many friends.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>Whoever despises his neighbor is a sinner,
            but blessed is he who is generous to the poor.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>Do they not go astray who devise evil?
            Those who devise good meet steadfast love and faithfulness.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>In all toil there is profit,
            but mere talk tends only to poverty.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>The crown of the wise is their wealth,
            but the folly of fools brings folly.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>A truthful witness saves lives,
            but one who breathes out lies is deceitful.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>In the fear of the Lord one has strong confidence,
            and his children will have a refuge.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life,
            that one may turn away from the snares of death.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>In a multitude of people is the glory of a king,
            but without people a prince is ruined.</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>Whoever is slow to anger has great understanding,
            but he who has a hasty temper exalts folly.</p>
        <p><b>30 </b>A tranquil heart gives life to the flesh,
            but envy makes the bones rot.</p>
        <p><b>31 </b>Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his Maker,
            but he who is generous to the needy honors him.</p>
        <p><b>32 </b>The wicked is overthrown through his evildoing,
            but the righteous finds refuge in his death.</p>
        <p><b>33 </b>Wisdom rests in the heart of a man of understanding,
            but it makes itself known even in the midst of fools.</p>
        <p><b>34 </b>Righteousness exalts a nation,
            but sin is a reproach to any people.</p>
        <p><b>35 </b>A servant who deals wisely has the king's favor,
            but his wrath falls on one who acts shamefully.</p>
