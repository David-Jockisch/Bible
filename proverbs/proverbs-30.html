        <h1>Proverbs 30</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>The words of Agur son of Jakeh. The oracle.
            The man declares, I am weary, O God;
                I am weary, O God, and worn out.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>Surely I am too stupid to be a man.
            I have not the understanding of a man.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>I have not learned wisdom,
            nor have I knowledge of the Holy One.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>Who has ascended to heaven and come down?
            Who has gathered the wind in his fists?
        Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment?
            Who has established all the ends of the earth?
        What is his name, and what is his son's name?
            Surely you know!</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>Every word of God proves true;
            he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Do not add to his words,
            lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>Two things I ask of you;
            deny them not to me before I die:</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>Remove far from me falsehood and lying;
            give me neither poverty nor riches;
            feed me with the food that is needful for me,</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>lest I be full and deny you
            and say, “Who is the Lord?”
        or lest I be poor and steal
            and profane the name of my God.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>Do not slander a servant to his master,
            lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>There are those who curse their fathers
            and do not bless their mothers.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>There are those who are clean in their own eyes
            but are not washed of their filth.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>There are those—how lofty are their eyes,
            how high their eyelids lift!</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>There are those whose teeth are swords,
            whose fangs are knives,
        to devour the poor from off the earth,
            the needy from among mankind.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>The leech has two daughters:
            Give and Give.
        Three things are never satisfied;
            four never say, “Enough”:</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>Sheol, the barren womb,
            the land never satisfied with water,
            and the fire that never says, “Enough.”</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>The eye that mocks a father
            and scorns to obey a mother
        will be picked out by the ravens of the valley
            and eaten by the vultures.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>Three things are too wonderful for me;
            four I do not understand:</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>the way of an eagle in the sky,
            the way of a serpent on a rock,
        the way of a ship on the high seas,
            and the way of a man with a virgin.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>This is the way of an adulteress:
            she eats and wipes her mouth
            and says, “I have done no wrong.”</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>Under three things the earth trembles;
            under four it cannot bear up:</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>a slave when he becomes king,
            and a fool when he is filled with food;</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>an unloved woman when she gets a husband,
            and a maidservant when she displaces her mistress.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>Four things on earth are small,
            but they are exceedingly wise:</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>the ants are a people not strong,
            yet they provide their food in the summer;</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>the rock badgers are a people not mighty,
            yet they make their homes in the cliffs;</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>the locusts have no king,
            yet all of them march in rank;</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>the lizard you can take in your hands,
            yet it is in kings' palaces.</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>Three things are stately in their tread;
            four are stately in their stride:</p>
        <p><b>30 </b>the lion, which is mightiest among beasts
            and does not turn back before any;</p>
        <p><b>31 </b>the strutting rooster, the he-goat,
            and a king whose army is with him.</p>
        <p><b>32 </b>If you have been foolish, exalting yourself,
            or if you have been devising evil,
            put your hand on your mouth.</p>
        <p><b>33 </b>For pressing milk produces curds,
            pressing the nose produces blood,
            and pressing anger produces strife.</p>
