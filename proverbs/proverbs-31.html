        <h1>Proverbs 31</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>The words of King Lemuel. An oracle that his mother taught him:</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>What are you doing, my son? What are you doing, son of my womb?
            What are you doing, son of my vows?</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>Do not give your strength to women,
            your ways to those who destroy kings.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
            it is not for kings to drink wine,
            or for rulers to take strong drink,</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>lest they drink and forget what has been decreed
            and pervert the rights of all the afflicted.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Give strong drink to the one who is perishing,
            and wine to those in bitter distress;</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>let them drink and forget their poverty
            and remember their misery no more.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>Open your mouth for the mute,
            for the rights of all who are destitute.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Open your mouth, judge righteously,
            defend the rights of the poor and needy.</p>
        <h3>The Woman Who Fears the Lord</h3>
        <p><b>10 </b>An excellent wife who can find?
            She is far more precious than jewels.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>The heart of her husband trusts in her,
            and he will have no lack of gain.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>She does him good, and not harm,
            all the days of her life.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>She seeks wool and flax,
            and works with willing hands.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>She is like the ships of the merchant;
            she brings her food from afar.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>She rises while it is yet night
            and provides food for her household
            and portions for her maidens.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>She considers a field and buys it;
            with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>She dresses herself with strength
            and makes her arms strong.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.
            Her lamp does not go out at night.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>She puts her hands to the distaff,
            and her hands hold the spindle.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>She opens her hand to the poor
            and reaches out her hands to the needy.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>She is not afraid of snow for her household,
            for all her household are clothed in scarlet.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>She makes bed coverings for herself;
            her clothing is fine linen and purple.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>Her husband is known in the gates
            when he sits among the elders of the land.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>She makes linen garments and sells them;
            she delivers sashes to the merchant.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>Strength and dignity are her clothing,
            and she laughs at the time to come.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>She opens her mouth with wisdom,
            and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>She looks well to the ways of her household
            and does not eat the bread of idleness.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>Her children rise up and call her blessed;
            her husband also, and he praises her:</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>“Many women have done excellently,
            but you surpass them all.”</p>
        <p><b>30 </b>Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain,
            but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.</p>
        <p><b>31 </b>Give her of the fruit of her hands,
            and let her works praise her in the gates.</p>
