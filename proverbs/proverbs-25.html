        <h1>Proverbs 25</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>It is the glory of God to conceal things,
            but the glory of kings is to search things out.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,
            so the heart of kings is unsearchable.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>Take away the dross from the silver,
            and the smith has material for a vessel;</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>take away the wicked from the presence of the king,
            and his throne will be established in righteousness.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Do not put yourself forward in the king's presence
            or stand in the place of the great,</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>for it is better to be told, “Come up here,”
            than to be put lower in the presence of a noble.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>What your eyes have seen
            do not hastily bring into court,
            for what will you do in the end,
            when your neighbor puts you to shame?</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Argue your case with your neighbor himself,
            and do not reveal another's secret,</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>lest he who hears you bring shame upon you,
            and your ill repute have no end.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>A word fitly spoken
            is like apples of gold in a setting of silver.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>Like a gold ring or an ornament of gold
            is a wise reprover to a listening ear.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest
            is a faithful messenger to those who send him;
            he refreshes the soul of his masters.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>Like clouds and wind without rain
            is a man who boasts of a gift he does not give.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>With patience a ruler may be persuaded,
            and a soft tongue will break a bone.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>If you have found honey, eat only enough for you,
            lest you have your fill of it and vomit it.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house,
            lest he have his fill of you and hate you.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>A man who bears false witness against his neighbor
            is like a war club, or a sword, or a sharp arrow.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>Trusting in a treacherous man in time of trouble
            is like a bad tooth or a foot that slips.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>Whoever sings songs to a heavy heart
            is like one who takes off a garment on a cold day,
            and like vinegar on soda.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat,
            and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink,</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>for you will heap burning coals on his head,
            and the Lord will reward you.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>The north wind brings forth rain,
            and a backbiting tongue, angry looks.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>It is better to live in a corner of the housetop
            than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>Like cold water to a thirsty soul,
            so is good news from a far country.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>Like a muddied spring or a polluted fountain
            is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>It is not good to eat much honey,
            nor is it glorious to seek one's own glory.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>A man without self-control
            is like a city broken into and left without walls.</p>
