        <h1>Proverbs 20</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler,
            and whoever is led astray by it is not wise.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>The terror of a king is like the growling of a lion;
            whoever provokes him to anger forfeits his life.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife,
            but every fool will be quarreling.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>The sluggard does not plow in the autumn;
            he will seek at harvest and have nothing.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>The purpose in a man's heart is like deep water,
            but a man of understanding will draw it out.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Many a man proclaims his own steadfast love,
            but a faithful man who can find?</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>The righteous who walks in his integrity—
            blessed are his children after him!</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>A king who sits on the throne of judgment
            winnows all evil with his eyes.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Who can say, “I have made my heart pure;
            I am clean from my sin”?</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>Unequal weights and unequal measures
            are both alike an abomination to the Lord.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>Even a child makes himself known by his acts,
            by whether his conduct is pure and upright.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>The hearing ear and the seeing eye,
            the Lord has made them both.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>Love not sleep, lest you come to poverty;
            open your eyes, and you will have plenty of bread.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>“Bad, bad,” says the buyer,
            but when he goes away, then he boasts.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>There is gold and abundance of costly stones,
            but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>Take a man's garment when he has put up security for a stranger,
            and hold it in pledge when he puts up security for foreigners.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a man,
            but afterward his mouth will be full of gravel.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>Plans are established by counsel;
            by wise guidance wage war.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets;
            therefore do not associate with a simple babbler.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>If one curses his father or his mother,
            his lamp will be put out in utter darkness.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>An inheritance gained hastily in the beginning
            will not be blessed in the end.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>Do not say, “I will repay evil”;
            wait for the Lord, and he will deliver you.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>Unequal weights are an abomination to the Lord,
            and false scales are not good.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>A man's steps are from the Lord;
            how then can man understand his way?</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>It is a snare to say rashly, “It is holy,”
            and to reflect only after making vows.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>A wise king winnows the wicked
            and drives the wheel over them.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord,
            searching all his innermost parts.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>Steadfast love and faithfulness preserve the king,
            and by steadfast love his throne is upheld.</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>The glory of young men is their strength,
            but the splendor of old men is their gray hair.</p>
        <p><b>30 </b>Blows that wound cleanse away evil;
            strokes make clean the innermost parts.</p>
