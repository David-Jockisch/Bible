        <h1>Proverbs 21</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord;
            he turns it wherever he will.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,
            but the Lord weighs the heart.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>To do righteousness and justice
            is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>Haughty eyes and a proud heart,
            the lamp of the wicked, are sin.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance,
            but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>The getting of treasures by a lying tongue
            is a fleeting vapor and a snare of death.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>The violence of the wicked will sweep them away,
            because they refuse to do what is just.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>The way of the guilty is crooked,
            but the conduct of the pure is upright.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>It is better to live in a corner of the housetop
            than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>The soul of the wicked desires evil;
            his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>When a scoffer is punished, the simple becomes wise;
            when a wise man is instructed, he gains knowledge.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>The Righteous One observes the house of the wicked;
            he throws the wicked down to ruin.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor
            will himself call out and not be answered.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>A gift in secret averts anger,
            and a concealed bribe, strong wrath.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous
            but terror to evildoers.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>One who wanders from the way of good sense
            will rest in the assembly of the dead.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>Whoever loves pleasure will be a poor man;
            he who loves wine and oil will not be rich.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>The wicked is a ransom for the righteous,
            and the traitor for the upright.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>It is better to live in a desert land
            than with a quarrelsome and fretful woman.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>Precious treasure and oil are in a wise man's dwelling,
            but a foolish man devours it.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>Whoever pursues righteousness and kindness
            will find life, righteousness, and honor.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>A wise man scales the city of the mighty
            and brings down the stronghold in which they trust.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>Whoever keeps his mouth and his tongue
            keeps himself out of trouble.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>“Scoffer” is the name of the arrogant, haughty man
            who acts with arrogant pride.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>The desire of the sluggard kills him,
            for his hands refuse to labor.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>All day long he craves and craves,
            but the righteous gives and does not hold back.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination;
            how much more when he brings it with evil intent.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>A false witness will perish,
            but the word of a man who hears will endure.</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>A wicked man puts on a bold face,
            but the upright gives thought to his ways.</p>
        <p><b>30 </b>No wisdom, no understanding, no counsel
            can avail against the Lord.</p>
        <p><b>31 </b>The horse is made ready for the day of battle,
            but the victory belongs to the Lord.</p>
