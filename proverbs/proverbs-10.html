        <h3>The Proverbs of Solomon</h3>
        <p><b>1 </b>A wise son makes a glad father,
            but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother.</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>Treasures gained by wickedness do not profit,
            but righteousness delivers from death.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>The Lord does not let the righteous go hungry,
            but he thwarts the craving of the wicked.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>A slack hand causes poverty,
            but the hand of the diligent makes rich.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>He who gathers in summer is a prudent son,
            but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who brings shame.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Blessings are on the head of the righteous,
            but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>The memory of the righteous is a blessing,
            but the name of the wicked will rot.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>The wise of heart will receive commandments,
            but a babbling fool will come to ruin.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Whoever walks in integrity walks securely,
            but he who makes his ways crooked will be found out.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>Whoever winks the eye causes trouble,
            and a babbling fool will come to ruin.</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life,
            but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>Hatred stirs up strife,
            but love covers all offenses.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b> On the lips of him who has understanding, wisdom is found,
            but a rod is for the back of him who lacks sense.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>The wise lay up knowledge,
            but the mouth of a fool brings ruin near.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>A rich man's wealth is his strong city;
            the poverty of the poor is their ruin.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>The wage of the righteous leads to life,
            the gain of the wicked to sin.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>Whoever heeds instruction is on the path to life,
            but he who rejects reproof leads others astray.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>The one who conceals hatred has lying lips,
            and whoever utters slander is a fool.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>When words are many, transgression is not lacking,
            but whoever restrains his lips is prudent.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>The tongue of the righteous is choice silver;
            the heart of the wicked is of little worth.</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>The lips of the righteous feed many,
            but fools die for lack of sense.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>The blessing of the Lord makes rich,
            and he adds no sorrow with it.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>Doing wrong is like a joke to a fool,
            but wisdom is pleasure to a man of understanding.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>What the wicked dreads will come upon him,
            but the desire of the righteous will be granted.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>When the tempest passes, the wicked is no more,
            but the righteous is established forever.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,
            so is the sluggard to those who send him.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>The fear of the Lord prolongs life,
            but the years of the wicked will be short.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>The hope of the righteous brings joy,
            but the expectation of the wicked will perish.</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>The way of the Lord is a stronghold to the blameless,
            but destruction to evildoers.</p>
        <p><b>30 </b>The righteous will never be removed,
            but the wicked will not dwell in the land.</p>
        <p><b>31 </b>The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom,
            but the perverse tongue will be cut off.</p>
        <p><b>32 </b>The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable,
            but the mouth of the wicked, what is perverse.</p>
