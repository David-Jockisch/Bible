        <h1>Proverbs 23</h1>
        
        <div class="content-box">

        <p><b>1 </b>When you sit down to eat with a ruler,
            observe carefully what is before you,</p>
        <p><b>2 </b>and put a knife to your throat
            if you are given to appetite.</p>
        <p><b>3 </b>Do not desire his delicacies,
            for they are deceptive food.</p>
        <p><b>4 </b>Do not toil to acquire wealth;
            be discerning enough to desist.</p>
        <p><b>5 </b>When your eyes light on it, it is gone,
            for suddenly it sprouts wings,
            flying like an eagle toward heaven.</p>
        <p><b>6 </b>Do not eat the bread of a man who is stingy;
            do not desire his delicacies,</p>
        <p><b>7 </b>for he is like one who is inwardly calculating.
            “Eat and drink!” he says to you,
            but his heart is not with you.</p>
        <p><b>8 </b>You will vomit up the morsels that you have eaten,
            and waste your pleasant words.</p>
        <p><b>9 </b>Do not speak in the hearing of a fool,
            for he will despise the good sense of your words.</p>
        <p><b>10 </b>Do not move an ancient landmark
            or enter the fields of the fatherless,</p>
        <p><b>11 </b>for their Redeemer is strong;
            he will plead their cause against you.</p>
        <p><b>12 </b>Apply your heart to instruction
            and your ear to words of knowledge.</p>
        <p><b>13 </b>Do not withhold discipline from a child;
            if you strike him with a rod, he will not die.</p>
        <p><b>14 </b>If you strike him with the rod,
            you will save his soul from Sheol.</p>
        <p><b>15 </b>My son, if your heart is wise,
            my heart too will be glad.</p>
        <p><b>16 </b>My inmost being will exult
            when your lips speak what is right.</p>
        <p><b>17 </b>Let not your heart envy sinners,
            but continue in the fear of the Lord all the day.</p>
        <p><b>18 </b>Surely there is a future,
            and your hope will not be cut off.</p>
        <p><b>19 </b>Hear, my son, and be wise,
            and direct your heart in the way.</p>
        <p><b>20 </b>Be not among drunkards
            or among gluttonous eaters of meat,</p>
        <p><b>21 </b>for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty,
            and slumber will clothe them with rags.</p>
        <p><b>22 </b>Listen to your father who gave you life,
            and do not despise your mother when she is old.</p>
        <p><b>23 </b>Buy truth, and do not sell it;
            buy wisdom, instruction, and understanding.</p>
        <p><b>24 </b>The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice;
            he who fathers a wise son will be glad in him.</p>
        <p><b>25 </b>Let your father and mother be glad;
            let her who bore you rejoice.</p>
        <p><b>26 </b>My son, give me your heart,
            and let your eyes observe my ways.</p>
        <p><b>27 </b>For a prostitute is a deep pit;
            an adulteress is a narrow well.</p>
        <p><b>28 </b>She lies in wait like a robber
            and increases the traitors among mankind.</p>
        <p><b>29 </b>Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
            Who has strife? Who has complaining?
        Who has wounds without cause?
            Who has redness of eyes?</p>
        <p><b>30 </b>Those who tarry long over wine;
            those who go to try mixed wine.</p>
        <p><b>31 </b>Do not look at wine when it is red,
            when it sparkles in the cup
            and goes down smoothly.</p>
        <p><b>32 </b>In the end it bites like a serpent
            and stings like an adder.</p>
        <p><b>33 </b>Your eyes will see strange things,
            and your heart utter perverse things.</p>
        <p><b>34 </b>You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea,
            like one who lies on the top of a mast.</p>
        <p><b>35 </b>“They struck me,” you will say, “but I was not hurt;
            they beat me, but I did not feel it.
        When shall I awake?
            I must have another drink.”</p>
