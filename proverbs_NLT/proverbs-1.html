        <h1>Proverbs 1</h1>

        <div class="content-box">

            <p><b>1 </b>These are the proverbs of Solomon, David’s son, king of Israel.</p>
            <p><b>2 </b>Their purpose is to teach people wisdom and discipline,

                to help them understand the insights of the wise.</p>
            <p><b>3 </b>Their purpose is to teach people to live disciplined and successful lives,
                to help them do what is right, just, and fair.</p>
            <p><b>4 </b>These proverbs will give insight to the simple,
                knowledge and discernment to the young.</p>
            <p><b>5 </b>Let the wise listen to these proverbs and become even wiser.
                Let those with understanding receive guidance</p>
            <p><b>6 </b>by exploring the meaning in these proverbs and parables,
                the words of the wise and their riddles.</p>
            <p><b>7 </b>Fear of the Lord is the foundation of true knowledge,
                but fools despise wisdom and discipline.</p>
                <h3>A Father’s Exhortation: Acquire Wisdom</h3>
            <p><b>8 </b>My child, listen when your father corrects you.
                Don’t neglect your mother’s instruction.</p>
            <p><b>9 </b>What you learn from them will crown you with grace
                and be a chain of honor around your neck.</p>
            <p><b>10 </b>My child, if sinners entice you,
                turn your back on them!</p>
            <p><b>11 </b>They may say, “Come and join us.
                Let’s hide and kill someone!
                Just for fun, let’s ambush the innocent!</p>
            <p><b>12 </b>Let’s swallow them alive, like the grave;
                let’s swallow them whole, like those who go down to the pit of death.</p>
            <p><b>13 </b>Think of the great things we’ll get!
                We’ll fill our houses with all the stuff we take.</p>
            <p><b>14 </b>Come, throw in your lot with us;
                we’ll all share the loot.”</p>
            <p><b>15 </b>My child, don’t go along with them!
                Stay far away from their paths.</p>
            <p><b>16 </b>They rush to commit evil deeds.
                They hurry to commit murder.</p>
            <p><b>17 </b>If a bird sees a trap being set,
                it knows to stay away.</p>
            <p><b>18 </b>But these people set an ambush for themselves;
                they are trying to get themselves killed.</p>
            <p><b>19 </b>Such is the fate of all who are greedy for money;
                it robs them of life.</p>
                <h3>Wisdom Shouts in the Streets</h3>
            <p><b>20 </b>Wisdom shouts in the streets.
                She cries out in the public square.</p>
            <p><b>21 </b>She calls to the crowds along the main street,
                to those gathered in front of the city gate:</p>
            <p><b>22 </b>“How long, you simpletons,
                will you insist on being simpleminded?
                How long will you mockers relish your mocking?              
                How long will you fools hate knowledge?</p>
            <p><b>23 </b>Come and listen to my counsel.
                I’ll share my heart with you               
                and make you wise.</p>
            <p><b>24 </b>“I called you so often, but you wouldn’t come.
                I reached out to you, but you paid no attention.</p>
            <p><b>25 </b>You ignored my advice
                and rejected the correction I offered.</p>
            <p><b>26 </b>So I will laugh when you are in trouble!
                I will mock you when disaster overtakes you—</p>
            <p><b>27 </b>when calamity overtakes you like a storm,
                when disaster engulfs you like a cyclone, 
                and anguish and distress overwhelm you.</p>
            <p><b>28 </b>“When they cry for help, I will not answer.
                Though they anxiously search for me, they will not find me.</p>
            <p><b>29 </b>For they hated knowledge
                and chose not to fear the Lord.</p>
            <p><b>30 </b>They rejected my advice
                and paid no attention when I corrected them.</p>
            <p><b>31 </b>Therefore, they must eat the bitter fruit of living their own way,
                choking on their own schemes.</p>
            <p><b>32 </b>For simpletons turn away from me—to death.
                Fools are destroyed by their own complacency.</p>
            <p><b>33 </b>But all who listen to me will live in peace,
                untroubled by fear of harm.”</p>
