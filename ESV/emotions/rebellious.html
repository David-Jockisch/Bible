                For there are many who are insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers, 
                especially those of the circumcision party.

                The prudent sees danger and hides himself,
                but the simple go on and suffer for it.

                And Samuel said,
                <br>
                “Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices,
                as in obeying the voice of the Lord?
                Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,
                and to listen than the fat of rams.
                For rebellion is as the sin of divination,
                and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry.
                Because you have rejected the word of the Lord,
                he has also rejected you from being king.”
