                As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, 
                as good stewards of God's varied grace: whoever speaks, 
                as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who 
                serves by the strength that God supplies—in order that in 
                everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. 
                To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

            At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land. 
            And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation 
            of the people of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh. 
            They brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and 
            showed them the fruit of the land. And they told him, “We 
            came to the land to which you sent us. It flows with milk and 
            honey, and this is its fruit. However, the people who dwell 
            in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very 
            large. And besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there. 
            The Amalekites dwell in the land of the Negeb. The Hittites, 
            the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country. And 
            the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and along the Jordan.”

            But Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, 
            “Let us go up at once and occupy it, for we are well able 
            to overcome it.”

                Then the Lord said, “I have surely seen the affliction 
                of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry 
                because of their taskmasters. I know their sufferings, 
                and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the 
                Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good 
                and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the 
                place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the 
                Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. And now, 
                behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, 
                and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians 
                oppress them. Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you 
                may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.” 
                But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to 
                Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?” 
                He said, “But I will be with you, and this shall be the 
                sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought 
                the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this 
                mountain.”

                Then Moses said to God, “If I come to the people of 
                Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent 
                me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what shall 
                I say to them?” God said to Moses, “I am who I am.” 
                And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel: ‘I am has 
                sent me to you.’” God also said to Moses, “Say this to 
                the people of Israel: ‘The Lord, the God of your fathers, 
                the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, 
                has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, and thus I 
                am to be remembered throughout all generations. Go and 
                gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, 
                ‘The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, 
                of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, “I 
                have observed you and what has been done to you in Egypt, 
                and I promise that I will bring you up out of the 
                affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the 
                Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, 
                and the Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.”’ 
                And they will listen to your voice, and you and the 
                elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say 
                to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has met with 
                us; and now, please let us go a three days' journey into 
                the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our 
                God.’ But I know that the king of Egypt will not let 
                you go unless compelled by a mighty hand. So I 
                will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all the 
                wonders that I will do in it; after that he will let you 
                go. And I will give this people favor in the sight of 
                the Egyptians; and when you go, you shall not go empty, 
                but each woman shall ask of her neighbor, and any 
                woman who lives in her house, for silver and gold jewelry, 
                and for clothing. You shall put them on your sons and on 
                your daughters. So you shall plunder the Egyptians.”

                <h3>Moses Given Powerful Signs</h3>

                <b>4</b>Then Moses answered, “But behold, they will not 
                believe me or listen to my voice, for they will say, ‘The 
                Lord did not appear to you.’” The Lord said to him, 
                “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A staff.” And he 
                said, “Throw it on the ground.” So he threw it on the 
                ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses ran from it. 
                But the Lord said to Moses, “Put out your hand and catch 
                it by the tail”—so he put out his hand and caught it, and 
                it became a staff in his hand— “that they may believe 
                that the Lord, the God of their fathers, the God of 
                Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has 
                appeared to you.” Again, the Lord said to him, “Put 
                your hand inside your cloak.” And he put his hand 
                inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his 
                hand was leprous like snow. Then God said, “Put 
                your hand back inside your cloak.” So he put his hand 
                back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, 
                it was restored like the rest of his flesh. “If they 
                will not believe you,” God said, “or listen to the 
                first sign, they may believe the latter sign. If they 
                will not believe even these two signs or listen to 
                your voice, you shall take some water from the Nile and 
                pour it on the dry ground, and the water that you shall 
                take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.”

                But Moses said to the Lord, “Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, 
                either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant, 
                but I am slow of speech and of tongue.” Then the Lord 
                said to him, “Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him 
                mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the 
                Lord? Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth 
                and teach you what you shall speak.” But he said, 
                “Oh, my Lord, please send someone else.” Then the 
                anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses and he said, 
                “Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know 
                that he can speak well. Behold, he is coming out to meet 
                you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. 
                You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth, 
                and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will 
                teach you both what to do. He shall speak for you to 
                the people, and he shall be your mouth, and you shall be 
                as God to him. And take in your hand this staff, with 
                which you shall do the signs.”
