                <span style="color: red;">But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, 
                ‘Where are you going?’ But because I have said these things 
                to you, sorrow has filled your heart. Nevertheless, I tell 
                you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if 
                I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, 
                I will send him to you. And when he comes, he will convict 
                the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment:  
                concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning 
                righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me 
                no longer; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this 
                world is judged.

                “I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot 
                bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will 
                guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his 
                own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he 
                will declare to you the things that are to come. He will 
                glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to 
                you. All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said 
                that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.</span>

                Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had 
                killed all the prophets with the sword. Then Jezebel sent a 
                messenger to Elijah, saying, “So may the gods do to me and more 
                also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them 
                by this time tomorrow.” Then he was afraid, and he arose 
                and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to 
                Judah, and left his servant there.

                But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness 
                and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he asked that 
                he might die, saying, “It is enough; now, O Lord, take away 
                my life, for I am no better than my fathers.” And he lay 
                down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel 
                touched him and said to him, “Arise and eat.” And he looked, 
                and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones 
                and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again. 
                And the angel of the Lord came again a second time and 
                touched him and said, “Arise and eat, for the journey is 
                too great for you.” And he arose and ate and drank, and 
                went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights 
                to Horeb, the mount of God.
                
                <h3>The Lord Speaks to Elijah</h3>
                There he came to a cave and lodged in it. And behold, 
                the word of the Lord came to him, and he said to him, “What 
                are you doing here, Elijah?” He said, “I have been very 
                jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts. For the people of 
                Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, 
                and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, 
                am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.” And 
                he said, “Go out and stand on the mount before the Lord.” 
                And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind 
                tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the 
                Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind 
                an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. 
                And after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not 
                in the fire. And after the fire the sound of a low whisper.
                And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his 
                cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. 
                And behold, there came a voice to him and said, “What are 
                you doing here, Elijah?” He said, “I have been very 
                jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts. For the people of 
                Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your 
                altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, 
                even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it 
                away.” And the Lord said to him, “Go, return on your 
                way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when you arrive, 
                you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria. And 
                Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over 
                Israel, and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah 
                you shall anoint to be prophet in your place. And the 
                one who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu put 
                to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu 
                shall Elisha put to death. Yet I will leave seven 
                thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to 
                Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.”

            How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever?
            How long will you hide your face from me?
            How long must I take counsel in my soul
            and have sorrow in my heart all the day?
            How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
            
            Consider and answer me, O Lord my God;
            light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death,
            lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed over him,”
            lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken.
            
            But I have trusted in your steadfast love;
            my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.
            I will sing to the Lord,
            because he has dealt bountifully with me.
