            to grant to those who mourn in Zion—
            to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,
            the oil of gladness instead of mourning,
            the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;
            that they may be called oaks of righteousness,
            the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified.

                Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord!
                O Lord, hear my voice!
                Let your ears be attentive
                to the voice of my pleas for mercy!
                
                If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities,
                O Lord, who could stand?
                But with you there is forgiveness,
                that you may be feared.
                
                I wait for the Lord, my soul waits,
                and in his word I hope;
                my soul waits for the Lord
                more than watchmen for the morning,
                more than watchmen for the morning.
                
                O Israel, hope in the Lord!
                For with the Lord there is steadfast love,
                and with him is plentiful redemption.
                And he will redeem Israel
                from all his iniquities.

            Why are you cast down, O my soul,
            and why are you in turmoil within me?
            Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
            my salvation and my God.
            
            My soul is cast down within me;
            therefore I remember you
            from the land of Jordan and of Hermon,
            from Mount Mizar.
            Deep calls to deep
            at the roar of your waterfalls;
            all your breakers and your waves
            have gone over me.
            By day the Lord commands his steadfast love,
            and at night his song is with me,
            a prayer to the God of my life.
            I say to God, my rock:
            “Why have you forgotten me?
            Why do I go mourning
            because of the oppression of the enemy?”
            As with a deadly wound in my bones,
            my adversaries taunt me,
            while they say to me all the day long,
            “Where is your God?”
            
            Why are you cast down, O my soul,
            and why are you in turmoil within me?
            Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
            my salvation and my God.

                Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
                Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So may the gods do to me and more also, if I do 
                not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.” Then he was afraid, and he 
                arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.

                But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree. 
                And he asked that he might die, saying, “It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am no 
                better than my fathers.” And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched 
                him and said to him, “Arise and eat.” And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked
                on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again. And the angel of the Lord
                came again a second time and touched him and said, “Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.” 
                And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to 
                Horeb, the mount of God.
            
                There he came to a cave and lodged in it. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and he 
                said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
