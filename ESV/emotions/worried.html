                do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by 
                prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests 
                be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses 
                all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in 
                Christ Jesus.

                Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, 
                whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, 
                whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if 
                there is anything worthy of praise, think about these 
                things. What you have learned and received and heard 
                and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace 
                will be with you.

                Now as they went on their way, Jesus entered a village. And 
                a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house. And she 
                had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and 
                listened to his teaching. But Martha was distracted with 
                much serving. And she went up to him and said, “Lord, do you 
                not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her 
                then to help me.” But the Lord answered her, “Martha, 
                Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, 
                but one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good 
                portion, which will not be taken away from her.”

                “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, 
                what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, 
                what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the 
                body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air: 
                they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your 
                heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than 
                they? And which of you by being anxious can add a single 
                hour to his span of life? And why are you anxious 
                about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they 
                grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even 
                Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 
                But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which 
                today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will 
                he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?  
                Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ 
                or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For 
                the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your 
                heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But 
                seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, 
                and all these things will be added to you.

                “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for 
                tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for 
                the day is its own trouble.
