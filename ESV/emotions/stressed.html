            For God alone my soul waits in silence;
            from him comes my salvation.
            He alone is my rock and my salvation,
            my fortress; I shall not be greatly shaken.
            
            How long will all of you attack a man
            to batter him,
            like a leaning wall, a tottering fence?
            They only plan to thrust him down from his high position.
            They take pleasure in falsehood.
            They bless with their mouths,
            but inwardly they curse. Selah
            
            For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence,
            for my hope is from him.
            He only is my rock and my salvation,
            my fortress; I shall not be shaken.
            On God rests my salvation and my glory;
            my mighty rock, my refuge is God.
            
            Trust in him at all times, O people;
            pour out your heart before him;
            God is a refuge for us.

            The next day Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood 
            around Moses from morning till evening. When Moses' father-in-law 
            saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, “What is this 
            that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all 
            the people stand around you from morning till evening?” And 
            Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me 
            to inquire of God; when they have a dispute, they come to me 
            and I decide between one person and another, and I make them 
            know the statutes of God and his laws.” Moses' father-in-law 
            said to him, “What you are doing is not good. You and the 
            people with you will certainly wear yourselves out, for the 
            thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it alone. 
            Now obey my voice; I will give you advice, and God be with you! 
            You shall represent the people before God and bring their cases 
            to God, and you shall warn them about the statutes and the 
            laws, and make them know the way in which they must walk and 
            what they must do. Moreover, look for able men from all the 
            people, men who fear God, who are trustworthy and hate a bribe, 
            and place such men over the people as chiefs of thousands, of 
            hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. And let them judge the 
            people at all times. Every great matter they shall bring to you, 
            but any small matter they shall decide themselves. So it will 
            be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you. 
            If you do this, God will direct you, you will be able to endure, 
            and all this people also will go to their place in peace.”

            So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all 
            that he had said. Moses chose able men out of all Israel and 
            made them heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, 
            of fifties, and of tens. And they judged the people at all 
            times. Any hard case they brought to Moses, but any small matter 
            they decided themselves.
