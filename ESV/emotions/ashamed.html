            <p> 
                Have mercy on me, O God,
                according to your steadfast love;
            according to your abundant mercy
                blot out my transgressions.
            Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,
                and cleanse me from my sin!
            
            For I know my transgressions,
                and my sin is ever before me.
            Against you, you only, have I sinned
                and done what is evil in your sight,
            so that you may be justified in your words
                and blameless in your judgment.
            </p>

            <p> 
                I will also speak of your testimonies before kings
                and shall not be put to shame,
            </p>

                <span style="color: red;">So everyone who acknowledges me before men, 
                I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven,
                but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before 
                my Father who is in heaven.</span>

                For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of 
                God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first 
                and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God 
                is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The 
                righteous shall live by faith.”
