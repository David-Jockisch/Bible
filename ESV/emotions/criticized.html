            Poverty and disgrace come to him who ignores instruction,
            but whoever heeds reproof is honored.
            </p>
            <b>Proverbs 13:18</b>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
            The ear that listens to life-giving reproof
            will dwell among the wise.
            Whoever ignores instruction despises himself,
            but he who listens to reproof gains intelligence.
            </p>
            <b>Proverbs 15:31-32</b>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
            It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise
            than to hear the song of fools.
            </p>
            <b>Ecclesiastes 7:5</b>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
            and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that an opponent may be put to shame, 
            having nothing evil to say about us.
            </p>
            <b>Titus 2:8</b>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
                Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his 
                brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer 
                of the law but a judge.
            </p>
