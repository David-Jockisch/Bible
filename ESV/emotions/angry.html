        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
            A hot-tempered man stirs up strife,
            but he who is slow to anger quiets contention.
            </p>
            <b>Proverbs 15:18</b>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
            Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty,
            and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.
            </p>
            <b>Proverbs 16:32</b>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
            Good sense makes one slow to anger,
            and it is his glory to overlook an offense.
            </p>
            <b>Proverbs 19:11</b>

            For an overseer, as God's steward, must be above reproach. 
            He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or 
            violent or greedy for gain, 
            </p>
            <b>Titus 1:7</b>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
                Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your 
                anger, and give no opportunity to the devil.
            </p>
            <b>Ephesians 4:26-27</b>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
            Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, 
            slow to speak, slow to anger; 
            </p>
            <b>James 1:19</b>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
            The vexation of a fool is known at once,
            but the prudent ignores an insult.
            </p>
            <b>Proverbs 12:16</b>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
            Whoever is slow to anger has great understanding,
            but he who has a hasty temper exalts folly.
            </p>
            <b>Proverbs 14:29</b>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
            A stone is heavy, and sand is weighty,
            but a fool's provocation is heavier than both.
            </p>
            <b>Proverbs 27:3</b>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
                <span style="color: red;">“You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall
                not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.’ 
                But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother 
                will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will
                be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ 
                will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering 
                your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother
                has something against you, leave your gift there before 
                the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother,
                and then come and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly
                with your accuser while you are going with him to court,
                lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the 
                judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. Truly, I
                say to you, you will never get out until you have paid
                the last penny</span>
