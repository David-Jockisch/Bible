            Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander
            be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one
            another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ
            forgave you.

            Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without
            which no one will see the Lord. See to it that no one fails 
            to obtain the grace of God; that no “root of bitterness” springs
            up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled; that 
            no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his 
            birthright for a single meal. For you know that afterward, 
            when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, 
            for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with 
            tears.

                And he said, “There was a man who had two sons. And the 
                younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the 
                share of property that is coming to me.’ And he divided his 
                property between them. Not many days later, the younger 
                son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far 
                country, and there he squandered his property in reckless 
                living. And when he had spent everything, a severe 
                famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need. 
                So he went and hired himself out to one of the 
                citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to 
                feed pigs. And he was longing to be fed with the pods 
                that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything.
                <br>
                “But when he came to himself, he said, ‘How many of 
                my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, 
                but I perish here with hunger! I will arise and go to
                my father, and I will say to him, “Father, I have sinned 
                against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to 
                be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants.
                ”’ And he arose and came to his father. But while he was
                still a long way off, his father saw him and felt 
                compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. 
                And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned 
                against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy 
                to be called your son.’ But the father said to 
                his servants, ‘Bring quickly the best robe, and put 
                it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his 
                feet. And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and 
                let us eat and celebrate. For this my son was dead, 
                and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.’ And 
                they began to celebrate.
                <br>
                “Now his older son was in the field, and as he 
                came and drew near to the house, he heard music and 
                dancing. And he called one of the servants and 
                asked what these things meant. And he said to him,
                ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the 
                fattened calf, because he has received him back safe 
                and sound.’ But he was angry and refused to go in. 
                His father came out and entreated him, but he answered 
                his father, ‘Look, these many years I have served you, and 
                I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a 
                young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends. But when
                this son of yours came, who has devoured your 
                property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf 
                for him!’ And he said to him, ‘Son, you are always with
                me, and all that is mine is yours. It was fitting to 
                celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, 
                and is alive; he was lost, and is found.’”
