                Hide not your face from me.
                Turn not your servant away in anger,
                O you who have been my help.
                Cast me not off; forsake me not,
                O God of my salvation!
                For my father and my mother have forsaken me,
                but the Lord will take me in.

            He went away from there and came to his hometown, and his 
            disciples followed him. And on the Sabbath he began to teach 
            in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, 
            “Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to 
            him? How are such mighty works done by his hands? Is not this 
            the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses 
            and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” 
            And they took offense at him. And Jesus said to them, “A 
            prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among 
            his relatives and in his own household.” And he could do 
            no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few 
            sick people and healed them. And he marveled because of 
            their unbelief.

            I cry aloud to God,
            aloud to God, and he will hear me.
            In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord;
            in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying;
            my soul refuses to be comforted.
            When I remember God, I moan;
            when I meditate, my spirit faints.
            You hold my eyelids open;
            I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
            I consider the days of old,
            the years long ago.
            I said, “Let me remember my song in the night;
            let me meditate in my heart.”
            Then my spirit made a diligent search:
            “Will the Lord spurn forever,
            and never again be favorable?
            Has his steadfast love forever ceased?
            Are his promises at an end for all time?
            Has God forgotten to be gracious?
            Has he in anger shut up his compassion?” 
            Then I said, “I will appeal to this,
            to the years of the right hand of the Most High.”
            I will remember the deeds of the Lord;
            yes, I will remember your wonders of old.
            I will ponder all your work,
            and meditate on your mighty deeds.
