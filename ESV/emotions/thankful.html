                Oh give thanks to the Lord; call upon his name;
                make known his deeds among the peoples!

                Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. 
                Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.

                For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be 
                rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,
            </p>

                And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which 
                indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful. Let the 
                word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing 
                one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and 
                spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. 
                And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the 
                name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father 
                through him.
