                After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a 
                vision: “Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall 
                be very great.”

                The Lord is my light and my salvation;
                whom shall I fear?
            The Lord is the stronghold of my life;
                of whom shall I be afraid?

            God is our refuge and strength,
            a very present help in trouble.
            Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way,
            though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea,
            though its waters roar and foam,
            though the mountains tremble at its swelling.

            And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered 
            together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit 
            and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.
