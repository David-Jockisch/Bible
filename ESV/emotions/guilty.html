            But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from 
            the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— 
            the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all 
            who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned 
            and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his 
            grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, 
            whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be 
            received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because 
            in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It 
            was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he 
            might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in 
            Jesus.

            Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. 
            By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the 
            law of faith. For we hold that one is justified by faith 
            apart from works of the law. Or is God the God of Jews 
            only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles 
            also, since God is one—who will justify the circumcised 
            by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. Do we 
            then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the 
            contrary, we uphold the law.

                There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are 
                in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has 
                set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and 
                death. For God has done what the law, weakened by the 
                flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness 
                of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the 
                flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the 
                law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to 
                the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who 
                live according to the flesh set their minds on the things 
                of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit 
                set their minds on the things of the Spirit. For to 
                set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind 
                on the Spirit is life and peace. For the mind that is 
                set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not 
                submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot. Those who are 
                in the flesh cannot please God.

                You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, 
                if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who 
                does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to 
                him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is 
                dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of 
                righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus 
                from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ 
                Jesus from the dead will also give life to your 
                mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.
                
                <h3>Heirs with Christ</h3>
                So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the 
                flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you 
                live according to the flesh you will die, but if by 
                the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, 
                you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit 
                of God are sons of God. For you did not 
                receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, 
                but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, 
                by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” The Spirit himself 
                bears witness with our spirit that we are children of 
                God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and 
                fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him 
                in order that we may also be glorified with him.

                Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in 
                deed and in truth.

                By this we shall know that we are of the truth and 
                reassure our heart before him; for whenever our heart 
                condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows 
                everything. Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, 
                we have confidence before God; and whatever we ask 
                we receive from him, because we keep his commandments 
                and do what pleases him. And this is his commandment, 
                that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and 
                love one another, just as he has commanded us. Whoever 
                keeps his commandments abides in God, and God in 
                him. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the 
                Spirit whom he has given us.
