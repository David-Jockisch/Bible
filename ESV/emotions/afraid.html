            Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat: Thus says the Lord to you,
             ‘Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed at this great horde,
              for the battle is not yours but God's.

                The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
                He makes me lie down in green pastures.
                He leads me beside still waters.
                He restores my soul.
                He leads me in paths of righteousness
                for his name's sake.
                Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
                I will fear no evil,
                for you are with me;
                your rod and your staff,
                they comfort me.
                You prepare a table before me
                in the presence of my enemies;
                you anoint my head with oil;
                my cup overflows.
                Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
                all the days of my life,
                and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord
                forever.

            The Lord is the stronghold of my life;

                Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the

                neither let them be afraid.
