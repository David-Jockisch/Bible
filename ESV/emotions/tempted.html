                Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. 
                The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”

                No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. 
                God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your 
                ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of 
                escape, that you may be able to endure it.

                For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help 
                those who are being tempted.

                Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be 
                tempted by the devil. And after fasting forty days and forty 
                nights, he was hungry. And the tempter came and said to him, 
                “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become 
                loaves of bread.” But he answered, “It is written,
                “‘Man shall not live by bread alone,
                    but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”
                Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on 
                the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, “If you are the 
                Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written,
                “‘He will command his angels concerning you,’
                and
                “‘On their hands they will bear you up,
                    lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”
                Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘You shall not put 
                the Lord your God to the test.’” Again, the devil took him 
                to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of 
                the world and their glory. And he said to him, “All these 
                I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.” 
                Then Jesus said to him, “Be gone, Satan! For it is written,
                “‘You shall worship the Lord your God
                    and him only shall you serve.’”
                Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were 
                ministering to him.
