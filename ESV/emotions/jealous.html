            Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct 
            let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom. But if you 
            have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not 
            boast and be false to the truth. This is not the wisdom that 
            comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. 
            For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be 
            disorder and every vile practice. But the wisdom from above 
            is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of 
            mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere. And a harvest 
            of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

                Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the 
                Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a 
                Cushite woman. And they said, “Has the Lord indeed 
                spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us 
                also?” And the Lord heard it. Now the man Moses was 
                very meek, more than all people who were on the face of 
                the earth. And suddenly the Lord said to Moses and to 
                Aaron and Miriam, “Come out, you three, to the tent of 
                meeting.” And the three of them came out. And the Lord 
                came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance 
                of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both 
                came forward. And he said, “Hear my words: If there 
                is a prophet among you, I the Lord make myself known to 
                him in a vision; I speak with him in a dream. Not so 
                with my servant Moses. He is faithful in all my house. 
                With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in 
                riddles, and he beholds the form of the Lord. Why then 
                were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?” 
                And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, 
                and he departed.

                When the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, 
                Miriam was leprous, like snow. And Aaron turned toward 
                Miriam, and behold, she was leprous. And Aaron said 
                to Moses, “Oh, my lord, do not punish us because we 
                have done foolishly and have sinned. Let her not be 
                as one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he 
                comes out of his mother's womb.” And Moses cried to 
                the Lord, “O God, please heal her—please.” But the 
                Lord said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her 
                face, should she not be shamed seven days? Let her be 
                shut outside the camp seven days, and after that she may 
                be brought in again.” So Miriam was shut outside the 
                camp seven days, and the people did not set out on the 
                march till Miriam was brought in again.

                For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not 
                use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but 
                through love serve one another. For the whole law is 
                fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as 
                yourself.” But if you bite and devour one another, 
                watch out that you are not consumed by one another.

                Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, 
                impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife,

                Now Korah the son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, 
                and Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of
                Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men. And they rose up 
                before Moses, with a number of the people of Israel, 
                250 chiefs of the congregation, chosen from the assembly,
                well-known men. They assembled themselves together 
                against Moses and against Aaron and said to them, “You 
                have gone too far! For all in the congregation are holy,
                every one of them, and the Lord is among them. Why 
                then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of 
                the Lord?” When Moses heard it, he fell on his face,
                and he said to Korah and all his company, 
                “In the morning the Lord will show who is his, 
                and who is holy, and will bring him near to him. 
                The one whom he chooses he will bring near to him. 
                Do this: take censers, Korah and all his company; 
                put fire in them and put incense on them before 
                the Lord tomorrow, and the man whom the Lord chooses 
                shall be the holy one. You have gone too far, sons 
                of Levi!” And Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, 
                you sons of Levi: is it too small a thing for 
                you that the God of Israel has separated you 
                from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near 
                to himself, to do service in the tabernacle of the 
                Lord and to stand before the congregation to 
                minister to them, and that he has brought you 
                near him, and all your brothers the sons of Levi 
                with you? And would you seek the priesthood also? 
                Therefore it is against the Lord that you and 
                all your company have gathered together. What is 
                Aaron that you grumble against him?”

                And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of 
                Eliab, and they said, “We will not come up. Is it a 
                small thing that you have brought us up out of a land 
                flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, 
                that you must also make yourself a prince over us? 
                Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing 
                with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields 
                and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? 
                We will not come up.” And Moses was very angry and 
                said to the Lord, “Do not respect their offering. I 
                have not taken one donkey from them, and I have not 
                harmed one of them.”
                
                And Moses said to Korah, “Be present, you and all 
                your company, before the Lord, you and they, and Aaron, 
                tomorrow. And let every one of you take his censer 
                and put incense on it, and every one of you bring 
                before the Lord his censer, 250 censers; you also, and 
                Aaron, each his censer.” So every man took his 
                censer and put fire in them and laid incense on them 
                and stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting with 
                Moses and Aaron. Then Korah assembled all the 
                congregation against them at the entrance of the tent 
                of meeting. And the glory of the Lord appeared to all 
                the congregation.
                
                And the Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
                “Separate yourselves from among this congregation, 
                that I may consume them in a moment.” And they fell 
                on their faces and said, “O God, the God of the spirits 
                of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry 
                with all the congregation?” And the Lord spoke to 
                Moses, saying, “Say to the congregation, Get away 
                from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.”
                
                Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and 
                the elders of Israel followed him. And he spoke to 
                the congregation, saying, “Depart, please, from the tents 
                of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest 
                you be swept away with all their sins.” So they got 
                away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. 
                And Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of 
                their tents, together with their wives, their sons, 
                and their little ones. And Moses said, “Hereby you 
                shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these 
                works, and that it has not been of my own accord. 
                If these men die as all men die, or if they are 
                visited by the fate of all mankind, then the Lord has 
                not sent me. But if the Lord creates something new, 
                and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with 
                all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into 
                Sheol, then you shall know that these men have despised 
                the Lord.”
                
                And as soon as he had finished speaking all these 
                words, the ground under them split apart. And the 
                earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their 
                households and all the people who belonged to Korah 
                and all their goods. So they and all that belonged 
                to them went down alive into Sheol, and the earth 
                closed over them, and they perished from the midst of 
                the assembly. And all Israel who were around them 
                fled at their cry, for they said, “Lest the earth 
                swallow us up!” And fire came out from the Lord 
                and consumed the 250 men offering the incense.
