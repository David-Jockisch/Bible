            Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct 
            let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom. But if you 
            have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not 
            boast and be false to the truth. This is not the wisdom that 
            comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. 
            For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be 
            disorder and every vile practice. But the wisdom from above 
            is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of 
            mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere. And a harvest 
            of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
