                If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives 
                generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.
                But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one 
                who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and 
                tossed by the wind. For that person must not suppose 
                that he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a 
                double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.

                Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not 
                with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told 
                him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless 
                I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my 
                finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into 
                his side, I will never believe.”

                Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and 
                Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus 
                came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.”  
                Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and see my 
                hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do 
                not disbelieve, but believe.” Thomas answered him, “My 
                Lord and my God!” Jesus said to him, “Have you believed 
                because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not 
                seen and yet have believed.”

            The disciples of John reported all these things to him. And 
            John, calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to the 
            Lord, saying, “Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look 
            for another?” And when the men had come to him, they said, 
            “John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you the one 
            who is to come, or shall we look for another?’” In that hour 
            he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, 
            and on many who were blind he bestowed sight. And he answered 
            them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind 
            receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, 
            and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good 
            news preached to them. And blessed is the one who is not 
            offended by me.”

            And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and, 
            kneeling before him, said, “Lord, have mercy on my son, for 
            he has seizures and he suffers terribly. For often he falls into
            the fire, and often into the water. And I brought him to your 
            disciples, and they could not heal him.” And Jesus answered, 
            “O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with 
            you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me.” 
            And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and 
            the boy was healed instantly. Then the disciples came to 
            Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not cast it out?”  
            He said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly, I 
            say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, 
            you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and 
            it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.”
