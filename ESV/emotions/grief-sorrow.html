            For my life is spent with sorrow,
            and my years with sighing;
            my strength fails because of my iniquity,
            and my bones waste away.
            <hr>
            But I trust in you, O Lord;
            I say, “You are my God.”

            When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with 
            her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and 
            greatly troubled. And he said, “Where have you laid him?” 
            They said to him, “Lord, come and see.” Jesus wept.

            After the death of Saul, when David had returned from striking 
            down the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag. And on 
            the third day, behold, a man came from Saul's camp, with his 
            clothes torn and dirt on his head. And when he came to David, 
            he fell to the ground and paid homage. David said to him, 
            “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I have escaped 
            from the camp of Israel.” And David said to him, “How did it 
            go? Tell me.” And he answered, “The people fled from the battle, 
            and also many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul 
            and his son Jonathan are also dead.” Then David said to the 
            young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and his son 
            Jonathan are dead?” And the young man who told him said, 
            “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was 
            Saul leaning on his spear, and behold, the chariots and the 
            horsemen were close upon him. And when he looked behind him, 
            he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, ‘Here I am.’ 
            And he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an 
            Amalekite.’ And he said to me, ‘Stand beside me and kill me, 
            for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.’ 
            So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that 
            he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown 
            that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and 
            I have brought them here to my lord.”

            Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and 
            so did all the men who were with him. And they mourned 
            and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for 
            Jonathan his son and for the people of the Lord and for 
            the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.

                The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.
                <br>
                Now it happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth 
                year, as I was in Susa the citadel, that Hanani, one of 
                my brothers, came with certain men from Judah. And I asked 
                them concerning the Jews who escaped, who had survived 
                the exile, and concerning Jerusalem. And they said to me, 
                “The remnant there in the province who had survived the 
                exile is in great trouble and shame. The wall of Jerusalem 
                is broken down, and its gates are destroyed by fire.”
                <br>
                <b>Nehemiah's Prayer</b>
                <br>
                As soon as I heard these words I sat down and wept and 
                mourned for days, and I continued fasting and praying 
                before the God of heaven. And I said, “O Lord God of 
                heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and 
                steadfast love with those who love him and keep his 
                commandments, let your ear be attentive and your eyes 
                open, to hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray 
                before you day and night for the people of Israel your 
                servants, confessing the sins of the people of Israel, 
                which we have sinned against you. Even I and my father's 
                house have sinned. We have acted very corruptly against 
                you and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, 
                and the rules that you commanded your servant Moses. 8 
                Remember the word that you commanded your servant Moses, 
                saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among 
                the peoples, but if you return to me and keep my 
                commandments and do them, though your outcasts are in 
                the uttermost parts of heaven, from there I will gather 
                them and bring them to the place that I have chosen, 
                to make my name dwell there.’ They are your servants 
                and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great 
                power and by your strong hand. O Lord, let your ear 
                be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the 
                prayer of your servants who delight to fear your name, 
                and give success to your servant today, and grant him 
                mercy in the sight of this man.”
                
                Now I was cupbearer to the king.

                The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
                He makes me lie down in green pastures.
                He leads me beside still waters.
                He restores my soul.
                He leads me in paths of righteousness
                for his name's sake.
                Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
                I will fear no evil,
                for you are with me;
                your rod and your staff,
                they comfort me.
                You prepare a table before me
                in the presence of my enemies;
                you anoint my head with oil;
                my cup overflows.
                Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
                all the days of my life,
                and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord
                forever.
