            <span style="color: red;">“Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life,
            what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, 
            what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body 
            more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they neither 
            sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly 
            Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And 
            which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span 
            of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the 
            lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, 
            yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed 
            like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field,
            which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, 
            will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? 
            Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or
            ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the
            Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly 
            Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the 
            kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things
            will be added to you.
            “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will 
            be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.</span>
