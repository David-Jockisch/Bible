                My flesh and my heart may fail,

                since you seek proof that Christ is speaking in me. He is not 
                weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you. For he 
                was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God. 
                For we also are weak in him, but in dealing with you we will 
                live with him by the power of God.
            </p>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
            Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should 
            leave me. But he said to me, <span style="color: red;">“My grace is sufficient for you, 
            for my power is made perfect in weakness.”</span> Therefore I will 
            boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power 
            of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then, 
            I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, 
            and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
            </p>

                who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, 
                by the power that enables him even to subject all things to 
                himself.
