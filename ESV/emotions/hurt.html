            Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we were willing to 
            be left behind at Athens alone, and we sent Timothy, our 
            brother and God's coworker in the gospel of Christ, to 
            establish and exhort you in your faith, that no one be moved 
            by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are 
            destined for this. For when we were with you, we kept telling 
            you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction, just as it 
            has come to pass, and just as you know. For this reason, 
            when I could bear it no longer, I sent to learn about your 
            faith, for fear that somehow the tempter had tempted you and 
            our labor would be in vain.

            <h3>Timothy's Encouraging Report</h3>
            But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought 
            us the good news of your faith and love and reported that you 
            always remember us kindly and long to see us, as we long to 
            see youâ€” for this reason, brothers, in all our distress 
            and affliction we have been comforted about you through your 
            faith. For now we live, if you are standing fast in the Lord.
