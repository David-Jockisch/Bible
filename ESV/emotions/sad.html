                But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman troubled 
                in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, 
                but I have been pouring out my soul before the Lord. Do 
                not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for all 
                along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and 
                vexation.” Then Eli answered, “Go in peace, and the God 
                of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him.” 
                And she said, “Let your servant find favor in your eyes.” 
                Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no 
                longer sad.

                Then he said to them, “Go your way. Eat the fat and drink 
                sweet wine and send portions to anyone who has nothing ready,
                 for this day is holy to our Lord. And do not be grieved, 
                 for the joy of the Lord is your strength.” So the Levites 
                 calmed all the people, saying, “Be quiet, for this day is 
                 holy; do not be grieved.” And all the people went their way 
                 to eat and drink and to send portions and to make great 
                 rejoicing, because they had understood the words that were 
                 declared to them.

                Why are you cast down, O my soul,
                and why are you in turmoil within me?
            Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
                my salvation and my God.
            
            My soul is cast down within me;
                therefore I remember you
            from the land of Jordan and of Hermon,
                from Mount Mizar.
            Deep calls to deep
                at the roar of your waterfalls;
            all your breakers and your waves
                have gone over me.
            By day the Lord commands his steadfast love,
                and at night his song is with me,
                a prayer to the God of my life.
            I say to God, my rock:
                “Why have you forgotten me?
            Why do I go mourning
                because of the oppression of the enemy?”
            As with a deadly wound in my bones,
                my adversaries taunt me,
            while they say to me all the day long,
                “Where is your God?”
            
            Why are you cast down, O my soul,
                and why are you in turmoil within me?
            Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
                my salvation and my God.
