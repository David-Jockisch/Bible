                Now out of the ground the Lord God had formed every beast of the field and 
                every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call 
                them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. The 
                man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast 
                of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him. So the 
                Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of 
                his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the Lord God had 
                taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. Then the man said,
                <p>
                “This at last is bone of my bones
                    and flesh of my flesh;
                she shall be called Woman,
                    because she was taken out of Man.”
                </p>
                <p>
                Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they 
                shall become one flesh. And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.

                Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already 
                approved what you do.

                Let your garments be always white. Let not oil be lacking on your head.
                
                Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life that he has 
                given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which 
                you toil under the sun. Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might, for 
                there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.

                Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head 
                of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior.
            </p>
            <b>Ephesians 5:22-23
            </b>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
                Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, 
                and do not be harsh with them. Children, obey your parents in everything, for this 
                pleases the Lord. Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged.
            </p>
            <b>Colossians 3:18-21
            </b>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
                Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, 
                they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives, when they see your respectful 
                and pure conduct. Do not let your adorning be external—the braiding of hair and the putting 
                on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear— but let your adorning be the hidden person 
                of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight 
                is very precious. For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, 
                by submitting to their own husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you 
                are her children, if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening.

                Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to 
                the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, 
                so that your prayers may not be hindered.
