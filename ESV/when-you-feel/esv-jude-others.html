                you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. 
                Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice 
                the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me 
                take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye? You 
                hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly 
                to take the speck out of your brother's eye.</span>

                This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries 
                of God. Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful. But with 
                me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In 
                fact, I do not even judge myself. For I am not aware of anything against myself, 
                but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me. Therefore do not 
                pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the 
                things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each 
                one will receive his commendation from God.

                My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the 
                Lord of glory. For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your 
                assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, and if you pay attention to 
                the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you 
                say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,” have you not 
                then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? Listen, 
                my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in 
                faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him? But you 
                have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones 
                who drag you into court? Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which 
                you were called?

                If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your 
                neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well. But if you show partiality, you are committing 
                sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. For whoever keeps the whole law 
                but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it. For he who said, “Do not commit 
                adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you 
                have become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so act as those who are to be 
                judged under the law of liberty. For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown 
                no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.

                Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother 
                or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge 
                the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. There is only one lawgiver and 
                judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?
