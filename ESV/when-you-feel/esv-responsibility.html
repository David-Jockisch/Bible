                For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after 
                Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. So Solomon did what was evil in 
                the sight of the Lord and did not wholly follow the Lord, as David his father 
                had done. Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of 
                Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem.

            My son, do not lose sight of these—
            keep sound wisdom and discretion,
            and they will be life for your soul
            and adornment for your neck.
            Then you will walk on your way securely,
            and your foot will not stumble.
            If you lie down, you will not be afraid;
            when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
            Do not be afraid of sudden terror
            or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes,
            for the Lord will be your confidence
            and will keep your foot from being caught.
            Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,
            when it is in your power to do it.

                And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we 
                want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” And he said to them, <span style="color: red;" 
                >“What do you want me to do for you?”</span> And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your 
                right hand and one at your left, in your glory.” Jesus said to them, <span style="color: red;" 
                >“You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism 
                with which I am baptized?”</span> And they said to him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to 
                them, <span style="color: red;"> “The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, 
                you will be baptized, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, 
                but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”</span> And when the ten heard it, they 
                began to be indignant at James and John. And Jesus called them to him and said to them, 
                <span style="color: red;">“You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their 
                great ones exercise authority over them. But it shall not be so among you. But whoever 
                would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you 
                must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, 
                and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</span>

                After he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum. 
                Now a centurion had a servant who was sick and at the point of death, who was highly 
                valued by him. When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the 
                Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant. And when they came to Jesus, they pleaded 
                with him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy to have you do this for him, for he loves 
                our nation, and he is the one who built us our synagogue.” And Jesus went with them. 
                When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, “Lord, 
                do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. Therefore 
                I did not presume to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed. For 
                I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and 
                he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does 
                it.” When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that 
                followed him, said, <span style="color: red;">“I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.”</span> And when 
                those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.
