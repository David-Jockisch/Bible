            For God alone my soul waits in silence;
            from him comes my salvation.
            He alone is my rock and my salvation,
            my fortress; I shall not be greatly shaken.
            </p>
            <p>Put no trust in extortion;
                set no vain hopes on robbery;
                if riches increase, set not your heart on them.</p>

                I said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself.” 
                But behold, this also was vanity. I said of laughter, “It is mad,” and of 
                pleasure, “What use is it?” I searched with my heart how to cheer my body 
                with wine—my heart still guiding me with wisdom—and how to lay hold on folly, 
                till I might see what was good for the children of man to do under heaven 
                during the few days of their life. I made great works. I built houses and 
                planted vineyards for myself. I made myself gardens and parks, and planted 
                in them all kinds of fruit trees. I made myself pools from which to water the 
                forest of growing trees. I bought male and female slaves, and had slaves who 
                were born in my house. I had also great possessions of herds and flocks, more 
                than any who had been before me in Jerusalem. I also gathered for myself 
                silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I got singers, both 
                men and women, and many concubines, the delight of the sons of man.

                So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also 
                my wisdom remained with me. And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep 
                from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in 
                all my toil, and this was my reward for all my toil. Then I considered all 
                that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, 
                all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing to be gained 
                under the sun.

                Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance 
                with me.” But he said to him, <span style="color: red;">“Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?”</span> 
                And he said to them, <span style="color: red;">“Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, 
                for one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.”</span> And he told 
                them a parable, saying, <span style="color: red;">“The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he 
                thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’ And 
                he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there 
                I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you 
                have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.”’ But God 
                said to him, ‘Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you 
                have prepared, whose will they be?’ So is the one who lays up treasure for himself 
                and is not rich toward God.”</span>

                The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows 
                bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must give as he has decided in 
                his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And 
                God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all 
                things at all times, you may abound in every good work. As it is written,
                <p>
                “He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor;
                    his righteousness endures forever.”

                He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your 
                seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness. You will be enriched 
                in every way to be generous in every way, which through us will produce thanksgiving 
                to God. For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the 
                saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God. By their approval of 
                this service, they will glorify God because of your submission that comes from your 
                confession of the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of your contribution for them 
                and for all others, while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing 
                grace of God upon you. Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!</p>

                But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, 
                as is proper among saints. Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, 
                which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving. For you may be sure of 
                this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an 
                idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you 
                with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of 
                disobedience. Therefore do not become partners with them;

                By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our 
                lives for the brothers. But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in 
                need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him? Little 
                children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.
