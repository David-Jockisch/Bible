                Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt. He took Pharaoh's daughter 
                and brought her into the city of David until he had finished building his own house and 
                the house of the Lord and the wall around Jerusalem. The people were sacrificing at the 
                high places, however, because no house had yet been built for the name of the Lord.

                Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of David his father, only he sacrificed 
                and made offerings at the high places. And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for 
                that was the great high place. Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that 
                altar. At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said, “Ask what 
                I shall give you.” And Solomon said, “You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant 
                David my father, because he walked before you in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in 
                uprightness of heart toward you. And you have kept for him this great and steadfast love 
                and have given him a son to sit on his throne this day. And now, O Lord my God, you have 
                made your servant king in place of David my father, although I am but a little child. I do 
                not know how to go out or come in. And your servant is in the midst of your people whom 
                you have chosen, a great people, too many to be numbered or counted for multitude. Give 
                your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, that I may discern 
                between good and evil, for who is able to govern this your great people?”
                
                It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this. And God said to him, “Because you 
                have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your 
                enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right, behold, 
                I now do according to your word. Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that 
                none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you. I give you 
                also what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that no other king shall compare 
                with you, all your days. And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my 
                commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.”

                A slack hand causes poverty,
                but the hand of the diligent makes rich.
            He who gathers in summer is a prudent son,
                but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who brings shame.

                I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a 
                living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not 
                be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing 
                you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.

                Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with 
                every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the 
                foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he 
                predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the 
                purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in 
                the Beloved. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, 
                according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight 
                making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth 
                in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven 
                and things on earth.

                In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of 
                him who works all things according to the counsel of his will, so that we who were the 
                first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you 
                heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with 
                the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire 
                possession of it, to the praise of his glory.
