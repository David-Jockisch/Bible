                â€œRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall 
                labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath 
                to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or 
                your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female 
                servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your 
                gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the 
                sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. 
                Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

                Oh come, let us sing to the Lord;
                let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!
            Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving;
                let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise!
            For the Lord is a great God,
                and a great King above all gods.
            In his hand are the depths of the earth;
                the heights of the mountains are his also.
            The sea is his, for he made it,
                and his hands formed the dry land.
            
            Oh come, let us worship and bow down;
                let us kneel before the Lord, our Maker!
            For he is our God,
                and we are the people of his pasture,
                and the sheep of his hand.

                And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the 
                fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. And 
                awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were 
                being done through the apostles. And all who believed were 
                together and had all things in common. And they were selling 
                their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds 
                to all, as any had need. And day by day, attending the temple 
                together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their 
                food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having 
                favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number 
                day by day those who were being saved.

                Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the 
                holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way 
                that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his 
                flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, 
                let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
                with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our 
                bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the confession 
                of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. 
                And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and 
                good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit 
                of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you 
                see the Day drawing near.
