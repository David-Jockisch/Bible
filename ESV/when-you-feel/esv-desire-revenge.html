                sealed up in my treasuries?
            Vengeance is mine, and recompense,
                for the time when their foot shall slip;
            for the day of their calamity is at hand,
                and their doom comes swiftly.’

                If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat,
                and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink,
            for you will heap burning coals on his head,
                and the Lord will reward you.

                ‘An eye for an eye and a 
                tooth for a tooth.’ But I say to you, Do not resist the 
                one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, 
                
                turn to him the other also. And if anyone would sue you and 
                take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. And if 
                anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give 
                to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who 
                would borrow from you.</span>

                Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable 
                in the sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends on you, live 
                peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave 
                it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I 
                will repay, says the Lord.” To the contrary, “if your enemy is 
                hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for 
                by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” Do not be 
                overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

                We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are 
                over you in the Lord and admonish you, and to esteem them very 
                highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 
                And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the 
                fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all. See that 
                no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to 
                one another and to everyone.

                Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, 
                a tender heart, and a humble mind. Do not repay evil for evil or 
                reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you 
                were called, that you may obtain a blessing. For

                “Whoever desires to love life
                    and see good days,
                let him keep his tongue from evil
                    and his lips from speaking deceit;
                let him turn away from evil and do good;
                    let him seek peace and pursue it.
                For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,
                    and his ears are open to their prayer.
                But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”
                
                Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? 
                But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you will 
                be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled,
