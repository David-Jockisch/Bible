        <div class="content-box">
            <p> 
                Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. Let 
                your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; 
                do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer 
                and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known 
                to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, 
                will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

                He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that 
                they were righteous, and treated others with contempt: 
                <span style="color: red;">“Two men 
                went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a 
                tax collector. The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: 
                ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, 
                adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; 
                I give tithes of all that I get.’ But the tax collector, 
                standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but 
                beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ I 
                tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than 
                the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but 
                the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span>

                And Jesus answered them, <span style="color: red;">“Have faith in God. Truly, I say 
                to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown 
                into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that 
                what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.  
                Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that 
                you have received it, and it will be yours. And whenever 
                you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, 
                so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your 
                trespasses.”</span>

            <p> 
                <span style="color: red;">“And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For 
                they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street 
                corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, 
                they have received their reward. But when you pray, go into your 
                room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. 
                And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

                “And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles 
                do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. 
                Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you 
                ask him. Pray then like this:
                
                “Our Father in heaven,
                hallowed be your name.
                Your kingdom come,
                your will be done,
                    on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread,
                and forgive us our debts,
                    as we also have forgiven our debtors.
                And lead us not into temptation,
                    but deliver us from evil.
                
                For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father 
                will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their 
                trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span>

                And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, 
                in the house of the Lord, before the new court, and said, “O 
                Lord, God of our fathers, are you not God in heaven? You rule 
                over all the kingdoms of the nations. In your hand are power and 
                might, so that none is able to withstand you. Did you not, our 
                God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people 
                Israel, and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your 
                friend? And they have lived in it and have built for you in 
                it a sanctuary for your name, saying, ‘If disaster comes upon 
                us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will 
                stand before this house and before you—for your name is in this 
                house—and cry out to you in our affliction, and you will hear 
                and save.’ And now behold, the men of Ammon and Moab and 
                Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade when they came 
                from the land of Egypt, and whom they avoided and did not 
                destroy— behold, they reward us by coming to drive us out 
                of your possession, which you have given us to inherit.  O 
                our God, will you not execute judgment on them? For we are 
                powerless against this great horde that is coming against us. 
                We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you.”

                Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five 
                cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the court, 
                and he stood on it. Then he knelt on his knees in the presence 
                of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward 
                heaven, and said, “O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God 
                like you, in heaven or on earth, keeping covenant and showing 
                steadfast love to your servants who walk before you with all 
                their heart, who have kept with your servant David my father 
                what you declared to him. You spoke with your mouth, and with 
                your hand have fulfilled it this day. Now therefore, O Lord, 
                God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you 
                have promised him, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man to sit 
                before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons pay close 
                attention to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked 
                before me.’ Now therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, let your 
                word be confirmed, which you have spoken to your servant David.

                “But will God indeed dwell with man on the earth? Behold, 
                heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you, how much 
                less this house that I have built! Yet have regard to the 
                prayer of your servant and to his plea, O Lord my God, 
                listening to the cry and to the prayer that your servant 
                prays before you, that your eyes may be open day and night 
                toward this house, the place where you have promised to set 
                your name, that you may listen to the prayer that your servant 
                offers toward this place. And listen to the pleas of your 
                servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this 
                place. And listen from heaven your dwelling place, and when 
                you hear, forgive.
                
                “If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take 
                an oath and comes and swears his oath before your altar in 
                this house, then hear from heaven and act and judge your 
                servants, repaying the guilty by bringing his conduct on his 
                own head, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him 
                according to his righteousness.
                
                “If your people Israel are defeated before the enemy 
                because they have sinned against you, and they turn again 
                and acknowledge your name and pray and plead with you in this 
                house, then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your 
                people Israel and bring them again to the land that you gave 
                to them and to their fathers.
                
                “When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because 
                they have sinned against you, if they pray toward this place 
                and acknowledge your name and turn from their sin, when you 
                afflict them, then hear in heaven and forgive the sin 
                of your servants, your people Israel, when you teach them 
                the good way in which they should walk, and grant rain 
                upon your land, which you have given to your people as an 
                inheritance.
                
                “If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence 
                or blight or mildew or locust or caterpillar, if their enemies 
                besiege them in the land at their gates, whatever plague, 
                whatever sickness there is, whatever prayer, whatever plea 
                is made by any man or by all your people Israel, each knowing 
                his own affliction and his own sorrow and stretching out his 
                hands toward this house, then hear from heaven your dwelling 
                place and forgive and render to each whose heart you know, 
                according to all his ways, for you, you only, know the hearts 
                of the children of mankind, that they may fear you and walk 
                in your ways all the days that they live in the land that you 
                gave to our fathers.
                
                “Likewise, when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, 
                comes from a far country for the sake of your great name and your 
                mighty hand and your outstretched arm, when he comes and prays 
                toward this house, hear from heaven your dwelling place and do 
                according to all for which the foreigner calls to you, in order 
                that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, 
                as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house 
                that I have built is called by your name.
                
                “If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by 
                whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to you toward 
                this city that you have chosen and the house that I have built 
                for your name, then hear from heaven their prayer and their 
                plea, and maintain their cause.
                
                “If they sin against you—for there is no one who does not 
                sin—and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so 
                that they are carried away captive to a land far or near, 
                yet if they turn their heart in the land to which they have been 
                carried captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of 
                their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned and have acted perversely 
                and wickedly,’ if they repent with all their heart and with 
                all their soul in the land of their captivity to which they 
                were carried captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave 
                to their fathers, the city that you have chosen and the house 
                that I have built for your name, then hear from heaven your 
                dwelling place their prayer and their pleas, and maintain their 
                cause and forgive your people who have sinned against you. 
                Now, O my God, let your eyes be open and your ears attentive to 
                the prayer of this place.
                
                “And now arise, O Lord God, and go to your resting place,
                    you and the ark of your might.
                Let your priests, O Lord God, be clothed with salvation,
                    and let your saints rejoice in your goodness.
                O Lord God, do not turn away the face of your anointed one!
                    Remember your steadfast love for David your servant.”
