            You will say in that day:
            “I will give thanks to you, O Lord,
            for though you were angry with me,
            your anger turned away,
            that you might comfort me.
            “Behold, God is my salvation;
            I will trust, and will not be afraid;
            for the Lord God is my strength and my song,
            and he has become my salvation.”

                Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.
                Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
                and cry to her
                that her warfare is ended,
                    that her iniquity is pardoned,
                that she has received from the Lord's hand
                    double for all her sins.
                <br>
                A voice cries:
                <br>
                “In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord;
                    make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
                Every valley shall be lifted up,
                    and every mountain and hill be made low;
                the uneven ground shall become level,
                    and the rough places a plain.
                And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,
                    and all flesh shall see it together,
                    for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.”
                <br>
                A voice says, “Cry!”
                    And I said, “What shall I cry?”
                All flesh is grass,
                    and all its beauty is like the flower of the field.
                The grass withers, the flower fades
                    when the breath of the Lord blows on it;
                    surely the people are grass.
                The grass withers, the flower fades,
                    but the word of our God will stand forever.
                <br>
                Go on up to a high mountain,
                    O Zion, herald of good news;
                lift up your voice with strength,
                    O Jerusalem, herald of good news;
                    lift it up, fear not;
                say to the cities of Judah,
                    “Behold your God!”
                Behold, the Lord God comes with might,
                    and his arm rules for him;
                behold, his reward is with him,
                    and his recompense before him.
                He will tend his flock like a shepherd;
                    he will gather the lambs in his arms;
                he will carry them in his bosom,
                    and gently lead those that are with young.

            “Hear the word of the Lord, O nations,
            and declare it in the coastlands far away;
            say, ‘He who scattered Israel will gather him,
            and will keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock.’
            For the Lord has ransomed Jacob
            and has redeemed him from hands too strong for him.
            They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion,
            and they shall be radiant over the goodness of the Lord,
            over the grain, the wine, and the oil,
            and over the young of the flock and the herd;
            their life shall be like a watered garden,
            and they shall languish no more.
            Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance,
            and the young men and the old shall be merry.
            I will turn their mourning into joy;
            I will comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow.

                Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and
                God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able
                to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we 
                ourselves are comforted by God. For as we share abundantly in Christ's sufferings, 
                so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too. If we are afflicted, it is 
                for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, 
                which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer. 
                Our hope for you is unshaken, for we know that as you share in our sufferings, you
                will also share in our comfort.

                But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus, and not 
                only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted by you, as 
                he told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced 
                still more. For even if I made you grieve with my letter, I do not regret it—though
                I did regret it, for I see that that letter grieved you, though only for a while. 
                As it is, I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you were grieved 
                into repenting. For you felt a godly grief, so that you suffered no loss through us.
                For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas
                worldly grief produces death. For see what earnestness this godly grief has produced
                in you, but also what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what fear, 
                what longing, what zeal, what punishment! At every point you have proved yourselves 
                innocent in the matter. So although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the 
                one who did the wrong, nor for the sake of the one who suffered the wrong, but in 
                order that your earnestness for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God. 
                Therefore we are comforted. And besides our own comfort, we rejoiced still more at 
                the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.
