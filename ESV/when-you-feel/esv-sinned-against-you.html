                And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred 
                men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two female servants. 
                And he put the servants with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel 
                and Joseph last of all. 3 He himself went on before them, bowing himself to the ground seven 
                times, until he came near to his brother.
                But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they 
                wept.

                When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph 
                will hate us and pay us back for all the evil that we did to him.” So they sent a message 
                to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this command before he died: ‘Say to Joseph, 
                “Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil 
                to you.”’ And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your 
                father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him. His brothers also came and fell down before 
                him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.” But Joseph said to them, “Do not fear, 
                for am I in the place of God? As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it 
                for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today.

                Then Peter came up and said to him, “Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, 
                and I forgive him? As many as seven times?” Jesus said to him, <span style="color: red;">“I do not say to you 
                seven times, but seventy-seven times.

                “Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle 
                accounts with his servants. When he began to settle, one was brought to him who 
                owed him ten thousand talents. And since he could not pay, his master ordered him 
                to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.  
                So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will 
                pay you everything.’ And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him 
                and forgave him the debt. But when that same servant went out, he found one of his 
                fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing him, he began to choke him, 
                saying, ‘Pay what you owe.’ So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him, 
                ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you.’ He refused and went and put him in prison 
                until he should pay the debt. When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they 
                were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all that had taken 
                place. Then his master summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave 
                you all that debt because you pleaded with me. And should not you have had mercy on 
                your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?’ And in anger his master delivered him 
                to the jailers, until he should pay all his debt. So also my heavenly Father 
                will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.”</span>

                Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, 
                meekness, and patience, bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, 
                forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. And above all 
                these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.

                So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty. For 
                judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
