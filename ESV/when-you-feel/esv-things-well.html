            “If I have made gold my trust
            or called fine gold my confidence,
            if I have rejoiced because my wealth was abundant
            or because my hand had found much,
            if I have looked at the sun when it shone,
            or the moon moving in splendor,
            and my heart has been secretly enticed,
            and my mouth has kissed my hand,
            this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges,
            for I would have been false to God above.

                Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance 
                with me.” But he said to him, <span style="color: red;">“Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?” 
                </span>And he said to them, <span style="color: red;">“Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one's 
                life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.” </span>And he told them a parable, 
                saying, <span style="color: red;">“The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he thought to himself, 
                ‘What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’ And he said, ‘I will do this: 
                I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and 
                my goods. And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; 
                relax, eat, drink, be merry.”’ But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your soul is 
                required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?’ So is the one 
                who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.”</span>

                If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord 
                Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness, he is puffed up with conceit and 
                understands nothing. He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about 
                words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions, and constant friction 
                among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness 
                is a means of gain. But godliness with contentment is great gain, for we brought nothing 
                into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. But if we have food and 
                clothing, with these we will be content. But those who desire to be rich fall into 
                temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into 
                ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is 
                through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves 
                with many pangs.

                <h3>Fight the Good Fight of Faith</h3>
                <p>
                But as for you, O man of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, 
                love, steadfastness, gentleness. Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the 
                eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the 
                presence of many witnesses. I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all 
                things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good 
                confession, to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing 
                of our Lord Jesus Christ, which he will display at the proper time—he who is the blessed 
                and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, who 
                dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and 
                eternal dominion. Amen.
                
                As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes 
                on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy. 
                They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, thus 
                storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future, so that they may 
                take hold of that which is truly life.</p>

                Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, 
                “I will never leave you nor forsake you.”

                My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord 
                of glory. For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, 
                and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, and if you pay attention to the one who 
                wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor 
                man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,” have you not then made distinctions 
                among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? Listen, my beloved brothers, 
                has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the 
                kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him? But you have dishonored the poor man. 
                Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court? Are they 
                not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called?

                If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your 
                neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well. But if you show partiality, you are committing 
                sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. For whoever keeps the whole law but 
                fails in one point has become guilty of all of it. For he who said, “Do not commit 
                adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you 
                have become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so act as those who are to be judged 
                under the law of liberty. For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. 
                Mercy triumphs over judgment.
                
                <h3>Faith Without Works Is Dead</h3>
                What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? 
                Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily 
                food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving 
                them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, 
                if it does not have works, is dead.
