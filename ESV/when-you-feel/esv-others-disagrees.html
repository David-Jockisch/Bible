            “Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be 
            judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the 
            speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? 
            Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there 
            is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and 
            then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.

            Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good. Love one another 
            with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor. Do not be slothful in zeal,
            be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, 
            be constant in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show 
            hospitality.

            Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who 
            rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, 
            but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight. Repay no one evil for 
            evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. If possible, so far 
            as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but 
            leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says 
            the Lord.” To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give 
            him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” Do not 
            be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

            As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions. One 
            person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. Let not 
            the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass 
            judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him. Who are you to pass judgment on 
            the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will 
            be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand.

            One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. 
            Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. The one who observes the day, 
            observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he 
            gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and 
            gives thanks to God. For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. 
            For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, 
            whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ died and 
            lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
            
            Why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? 
            For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God; for it is written,
            
            “As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,
                and every tongue shall confess to God.”
            
            So then each of us will give an account of himself to God.
            
            Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never 
            to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother. I know and am persuaded 
            in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for anyone 
            who thinks it unclean. For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no 
            longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died. 
            So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil. For the kingdom of God is 
            not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy 
            Spirit. Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men. So then 
            let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.
            
            Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, 
            but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats. It is good not 
            to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble. The 
            faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who has no 
            reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves. But whoever has doubts is 
            condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not 
            proceed from faith is sin.

            <b>15</b> We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, 
            and not to please ourselves. Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to 
            build him up. For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, “The reproaches 
            of those who reproached you fell on me.” For whatever was written in former days was 
            written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of 
            the Scriptures we might have hope. May the God of endurance and encouragement grant 
            you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus, that 
            together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
            Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.

                Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others. But what we are is 
                known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience. We are not commending 
                ourselves to you again but giving you cause to boast about us, so that you may be 
                able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the 
                heart. For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, 
                it is for you. For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: 
                that one has died for all, therefore all have died; and he died for all, that those 
                who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and 
                was raised.

                From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once 
                regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. Therefore, if 
                anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new 
                has come. All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave 
                us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world 
                to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the 
                message of reconciliation. Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his 
                appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our 
                sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the 
                righteousness of God.
