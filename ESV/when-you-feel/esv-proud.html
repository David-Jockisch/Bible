            “I, wisdom, dwell with prudence,
            and I find knowledge and discretion.
            The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil.
            Pride and arrogance and the way of evil
            and perverted speech I hate.
            I have counsel and sound wisdom;
            I have insight; I have strength.

                Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, 
                inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was 
                hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and 
                you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I 
                was in prison and you came to me.’ Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, 
                when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did 
                we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see 
                you sick or in prison and visit you?’ And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to 
                you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’

                And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we 
                want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” And he said to them, <span style="color: red;" 
                >“What do you want me to do for you?”</span> And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your 
                right hand and one at your left, in your glory.” Jesus said to them, <span style="color: red;" 
                >“You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism 
                with which I am baptized?”</span> And they said to him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to 
                them, <span style="color: red;"> “The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, 
                you will be baptized, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, 
                but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”</span> And when the ten heard it, they 
                began to be indignant at James and John. And Jesus called them to him and said to them, 
                <span style="color: red;">“You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their 
                great ones exercise authority over them. But it shall not be so among you. But whoever 
                would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you 
                must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, 
                and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</span>

                For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think,
                but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned.

                So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, 
                any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, 
                complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, 
                being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfish 
                ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant 
                than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, 
                but also to the interests of others. Have this mind among yourselves, 
                which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of 
                God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but 
                emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the 
                likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself 
                by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. 
                Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that 
                is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should 
                bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue 
                confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
