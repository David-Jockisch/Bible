        <h1>Seeking Gods Direction</h1>
        <div class="content-box">
        <p> Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt. He took Pharaoh's daughter
             and brought her into the city of David until he had finished building his own house and
              the house of the Lord and the wall around Jerusalem. The people were sacrificing at 
              the high places, however, because no house had yet been built for the name of the 
              Lord.
            Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of David his father, only he sacrificed 
            and made offerings at the high places. And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, 
            for that was the great high place. Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on 
            that altar. At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said,
            “Ask what I shall give you.”And Solomon said, “You have shown great and steadfast love 
            to your servant David my father, because he walked before you in faithfulness, 
            in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward you. And you have kept for him
            this great and steadfast love and have given him a son to sit on his throne this day.
            And now, O Lord my God, you have made your servant king in place of David my father,
            although I am but a little child. I do not know how to go out or come in. And your 
            servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people, too
            many to be numbered or counted for multitude. Give your servant therefore an 
            understanding mind to govern your people, that I may discern between good and evil,
            for who is able to govern this your great people?”
            It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this. And God said to him, “Because you have 
            asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your 
            enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right, behold, 
            I now do according to your word. Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that 
            none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you. I give you 
            also what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that no other king shall compare
            with you, all your days. And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my 
            commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.”

        <p>My son, if you receive my words
            and treasure up my commandments with you,
        making your ear attentive to wisdom
            and inclining your heart to understanding;
        yes, if you call out for insight
            and raise your voice for understanding,
        if you seek it like silver
            and search for it as for hidden treasures,
        then you will understand the fear of the Lord
            and find the knowledge of God.
        For the Lord gives wisdom;
            from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;

        <p>
            I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as 
            a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not
            be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by 
            testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
            For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more 
            highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the 
            measure of faith that God has assigned.

            Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the
            time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the
            will of the Lord is.

            And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may
            be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, 
            so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him: bearing fruit in
            every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; being strengthened with all
            power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy; 
            giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of
            the saints in light. He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred
            us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness 
            of sins.

    <b>Colossians 1:9-14</b>

    <div class="content-box">
        <p>
        If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, 
        and it will be given him. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts
        is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. For that person must not 
        suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in
        all his ways.
