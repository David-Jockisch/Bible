                Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of 
                the field that the Lord God had made.

                He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You 
                shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?” And the 
                woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of 
                the trees in the garden, but God said, ‘You shall not 
                eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the 
                garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’” But 
                the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. 
                For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be 
                opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” 
                So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and 
                that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was 
                to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit 
                and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was 
                with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both were 
                opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they 
                sewed fig leaves together and made themselves 
                loincloths.

            <b>Genesis 3:1-7</b>
        </div>

                I said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with 
                pleasure; enjoy yourself.” But behold, this also was 
                vanity. I said of laughter, “It is mad,” and of 
                pleasure, “What use is it?” I searched with my heart 
                how to cheer my body with wine—my heart still guiding 
                me with wisdom—and how to lay hold on folly, till I 
                might see what was good for the children of man to 
                do under heaven during the few days of their life. 
                I made great works. I built houses and planted 
                vineyards for myself. I made myself gardens and 
                parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees. 
                I made myself pools from which to water the forest of 
                growing trees. I bought male and female slaves, and 
                had slaves who were born in my house. I had also great 
                possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had 
                been before me in Jerusalem. I also gathered for 
                myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and 
                provinces. I got singers, both men and women, and 
                many concubines, the delight of the sons of man.

                So I became great and surpassed all who were before 
                me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me. And 
                whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I 
                kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found 
                pleasure in all my toil, and this was my reward for 
                all my toil. Then I considered all that my hands 
                had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, 
                and behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, 
                and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.

                Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what 
                partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what 
                fellowship has light with darkness? What accord has 
                Christ with Belial? Or what portion does a believer 
                share with an unbeliever? What agreement has the temple 
                of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living 
                God; as God said,

                “I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them,
                and I will be their God,
                and they shall be my people.
                Therefore go out from their midst,
                and be separate from them, says the Lord,
                and touch no unclean thing;
                then I will welcome you,
                and I will be a father to you,
                and you shall be sons and daughters to me,
                says the Lord Almighty.”
                <b>7 </b>Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse 
                ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, 
                bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.

                If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his 
                tongue but deceives his heart, this person's religion is 
                worthless. Religion that is pure and undefiled before 
                God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in 
                their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the 
                world.

                You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship 
                with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever 
                wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy 
                of God. Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the 
                Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit 
                that he has made to dwell in us”? But he gives more 
                grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud but 
                gives grace to the humble.” Submit yourselves 
                therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee 
                from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to 
                you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your 
                hearts, you double-minded. Be wretched and mourn and 
                weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your 
                joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, 
                and he will exalt you.

                Do not love the world or the things in the world. 
                If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father 
                is not in him. For all that is in the world—the 
                desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and 
                pride of life—is not from the Father but is from 
                the world. And the world is passing away along 
                with its desires, but whoever does the will of God 
                abides forever.
