        <p>“Sing, O barren one, who did not bear;
            break forth into singing and cry aloud,
            you who have not been in labor!
        For the children of the desolate one will be more
            than the children of her who is married,” says the Lord.
         “Enlarge the place of your tent,
            and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out;
        do not hold back; lengthen your cords
            and strengthen your stakes.
         For you will spread abroad to the right and to the left,
            and your offspring will possess the nations
            and will people the desolate cities.
        
         “Fear not, for you will not be ashamed;
            be not confounded, for you will not be disgraced;
        for you will forget the shame of your youth,
            and the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more.
         For your Maker is your husband,
            the Lord of hosts is his name;
        and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer,
            the God of the whole earth he is called.
         For the Lord has called you
            like a wife deserted and grieved in spirit,
        like a wife of youth when she is cast off,
            says your God.
         For a brief moment I deserted you,
            but with great compassion I will gather you. <br>

            <p>Remember my affliction and my wanderings,
                the wormwood and the gall!
             My soul continually remembers it
                and is bowed down within me.
             But this I call to mind,
                and therefore I have hope:
            
             The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;
                his mercies never come to an end;
             they are new every morning;
                great is your faithfulness.
             “The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,
                “therefore I will hope in him.”</p>

            <p>But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 
                For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all 
                die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, 
                then at his coming those who belong to Christ. Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to 
                God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. For he must reign until he 
                has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. For “God has put all 
                things in subjection under his feet.” But when it says, “all things are put in subjection,” it is
                 plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him. When all things are subjected 
                 to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under 
                 him, that God may be all in all.</p>

            <p>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,

                To those who are elect exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia
                , according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for 
                obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood:
                May grace and peace be multiplied to you.
                Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has 
                caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the 
                dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,
                 who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the 
                 last time. In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been 
                 grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold 
                 that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor 
                 at the revelation of Jesus Christ. Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not
                  now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory,
                   obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

            <p>And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his
                 eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. 
                 To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</p>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p>Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, 
                “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall 
                reign forever and ever.” And the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell 
                on their faces and worshiped God, saying,<br>
                “We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,
                    who is and who was,
                for you have taken your great power
                    and begun to reign.
                The nations raged,
                    but your wrath came,
                    and the time for the dead to be judged,
                and for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints,
                    and those who fear your name,
                    both small and great,
                and for destroying the destroyers of the earth.”
                Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple. 
                There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.
