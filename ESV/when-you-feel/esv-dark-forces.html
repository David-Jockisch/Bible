                Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the land that I 
                swore to their fathers to give them. Only be strong and very courageous, being careful 
                to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn from 
                it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go. 
                This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day
                and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For 
                then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success. Have I not 
                commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, 
                for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.”

                Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples on me;
                all day long an attacker oppresses me;
            my enemies trample on me all day long,
                for many attack me proudly.
            When I am afraid,
                I put my trust in you.
            In God, whose word I praise,
                in God I trust; I shall not be afraid.
                What can flesh do to me?

                For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor 
                things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, 
                will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

                But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God 
                and not to us. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven 
                to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying 
                in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our 
                bodies. For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that 
                the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So death is at work in us, 
                but life in you.

                Since we have the same spirit of faith according to what has been written, “I believed, 
                and so I spoke,” we also believe, and so we also speak, knowing that he who raised the 
                Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. For it 
                is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase 
                thanksgiving, to the glory of God.
                
                So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is 
                being renewed day by day. For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an 
                eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are 
                seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but 
                the things that are unseen are eternal.

                Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole 
                armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. For 
                we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, 
                against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil 
                in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able 
                to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. Stand therefore, 
                having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 
                and, as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. 
                In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the 
                flaming darts of the evil one; and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the 
                Spirit, which is the word of God, praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer 
                and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for
                all the saints, 
            </p>

                For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching 
                ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will 
                turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths. As for you, always be 
                sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.

                For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has 
                come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
