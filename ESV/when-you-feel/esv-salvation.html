            “Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him;
            I will protect him, because he knows my name.
            When he calls to me, I will answer him;
            I will be with him in trouble;
            I will rescue him and honor him.
            With long life I will satisfy him
                and show him my salvation.”

            <p> 
            Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity
            and passing over transgression
            for the remnant of his inheritance?
            He does not retain his anger forever,
            because he delights in steadfast love.
            He will again have compassion on us;
            he will tread our iniquities underfoot.
            You will cast all our sins
            into the depths of the sea.
            You will show faithfulness to Jacob
            and steadfast love to Abraham,
            as you have sworn to our fathers
            from the days of old.

                <span style="color: red;">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the 
                Son of Man be 
                lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.
                “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes 
                in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into 
                the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. 
                Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned 
                already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is 
                the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather 
                than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things 
                hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.
                But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen 
                that his works have been carried out in God.”</span>

                    believes in me, though he die, yet shall 
                    he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?”</span>

                    And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.” 
                    And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. And he 
                    took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, 
                    he and all his family. Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. 
                    And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.

                    If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the 
                    testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son. Whoever believes in the Son of God 
                    has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has 
                    not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son. And this is the testimony, 
                    that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever 
                    does not have the Son of God does not have life.

                    
                    I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that 
                    you have eternal life.
