            <p> 
                Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness!
                You have given me relief when I was in distress.
                Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!
            <br>
            O men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame?
                How long will you love vain words and seek after lies? 
            But know that the Lord has set apart the godly for himself;
                the Lord hears when I call to him.
            <br>
            Be angry, and do not sin;
                ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. 
            Offer right sacrifices,
                and put your trust in the Lord.
            <br>
            There are many who say, “Who will show us some good?
                Lift up the light of your face upon us, O Lord!”
            You have put more joy in my heart
                than they have when their grain and wine abound.
            <br>
            In peace I will both lie down and sleep;
                for you alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.
            </p>

                Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty,
                and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.

                or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;

            <p> 
                Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, 
                as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear. And do not grieve the 
                Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness 
                and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. 
                Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.
                Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us 
                and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

                Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord. 
                See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God; that no “root of bitterness” springs 
                up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled;

            <b>Hebrews 12:14-15

            <p> 
            Truly God is good to Israel,
                to those who are pure in heart.
            But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled,
                my steps had nearly slipped.
            For I was envious of the arrogant
                when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
            <br>
            For they have no pangs until death;
                their bodies are fat and sleek.
            They are not in trouble as others are;
                they are not stricken like the rest of mankind.
            Therefore pride is their necklace;
                violence covers them as a garment.
            Their eyes swell out through fatness;
                their hearts overflow with follies.
            They scoff and speak with malice;
                loftily they threaten oppression.
            They set their mouths against the heavens,
                and their tongue struts through the earth.
            Therefore his people turn back to them,
                and find no fault in them.
            And they say, “How can God know?
                Is there knowledge in the Most High?”
            Behold, these are the wicked;
                always at ease, they increase in riches.
            All in vain have I kept my heart clean
                and washed my hands in innocence.
            For all the day long I have been stricken
                and rebuked every morning.
            If I had said, “I will speak thus,”
                I would have betrayed the generation of your children.
                <br>
            But when I thought how to understand this,
                it seemed to me a wearisome task,
            until I went into the sanctuary of God;
                then I discerned their end.
                <br>
            Truly you set them in slippery places;
                you make them fall to ruin.
            How they are destroyed in a moment,
                swept away utterly by terrors!
            Like a dream when one awakes,
                O Lord, when you rouse yourself, you despise them as phantoms.
            When my soul was embittered,
                when I was pricked in heart,
            I was brutish and ignorant;
                I was like a beast toward you.
                <br>
            Nevertheless, I am continually with you;
                you hold my right hand.
            You guide me with your counsel,
                and afterward you will receive me to glory.
            Whom have I in heaven but you?
                And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.
            My flesh and my heart may fail,
                but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
                <br>
            For behold, those who are far from you shall perish;
                you put an end to everyone who is unfaithful to you.
            But for me it is good to be near God;
                I have made the Lord God my refuge,
                that I may tell of all your works.
