    <h1>In His Arms</h1>
    <h3>"And He took them in His arms and began blessing them, laying His hands on them." Mark 10:16</h3>


    <div class="content-box">
        <h1>F.S.B.C. is starting a new ministry!</h1>

        <p>"In His Arms" will be an umbrella name for several new projects:
            <em><b>Blessing Bags, Disaster Relief,</em></b> and <em><b> Kids 
            Clothes Swap</em></b> </p>

        
    </div>  
    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>Blessing Bags</h2>
        <p>We have several Blessing Bags that have been donated for people
            in immediate need for food. (Non-parishable food items.) <br>
            This is not a food pantry.
        </p>
        <p><em>**This will be available as a Community Outreach.</em></p>
    </div>  

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>Disaster Relief</h2>
        <p>We will have several sizes of sweatpants, t-shirts and a few 
            toiletries available for an immediate need for disaster victims
            such as a natural disaster or a house fire.</p>
            <p><em>**This will be available as a Community Outreach.</em></p>
        </div>  

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Kid's Clothes Swap</h2>
            <p>April 5th we will be starting a childrens clothing swap project. 
                Parents can bring up to 7 items of their kids clothing and swap them 
                out for up to 7 items from the closet.</p>
                <p>Since this is a brand new project, we are offering this service 
                for attendees of the FSBC only (at this time) and will be 
                available after worship on most Sundays. <em><b>All clothes need to be 
                in good condition, clean and ready to be added to the closet.</b></em></p>
                <p><em>** No toys or other items like cribs, walkers, etc.</em></p>
                <p><em>** Clothing items, shoes, boots, coats only</em></p>
                <p><em>** Socks and underwear must be new in package</em></p>
