        <h3>Baptist Children's Home and Family Services</h3>
        <p>Since 1918, Baptist Children's Home and Family Services (BCHFS)
            has been a source of hope and healing, strenghtening families 
            across Illinois by sharing hope in Christ. For the parents whose teen
            is struggling, the child whose home is no longer safe, the young
            women facing an unexpected pregnancy, the infertile couple
            whose greatest dream is to be a Mom and Dad, or the individual 
            family in need of counseling, BCHFS is here to help. The five
            ministries that make up our mission: Angels' Cove Maternity Home, 
            Baptist Children's Home, Faith Adoption Services, GraceHaven Pregnancy 
            Resource Clinic, and Pathways Counseling. <br>
            <em><b>FSBC- Rushville would like to collect 75 packages 
            of BABY WIPES to be divided between Angel's Cove Maternity
            Home & GraceHaven Pregnancy Resource Clinic</b></em>
