        <div class="content-box">
            <h3>Warning Against Adultery</h3>
            <p><b>1 </b>My son, pay attention to my wisdom,
                Incline your ear to my discernment;</p>
            <p><b>2 </b>That you may keep discretion
                And that your lips may guard knowledge.</p>
            <p><b>3 </b>
                For the lips of a strange woman drip honey
                And smoother than oil is her speech;</p>
            <p><b>4 </b>But her end is bitter as wormwood,
                Sharp as a two‑edged sword.</p>
            <p><b>5 </b>
                Her feet go down to death,
                Her steps take hold of Sheol,</p>
            <p><b>6 </b>
                Lest she watch the path of life;
                Her tracks are unstable, she does not know it.</p>
            <p><b>7 </b>
                So now, my sons, listen to me
                And do not turn away from the words of my mouth.</p>
            <p><b>8 </b>Keep your way far from her
                And do not go near the door of her house,</p>
            <p><b>9 </b>Lest you give your splendor to others
                And your years to the cruel one;</p>
            <p><b>10 </b>
                Lest strangers be satisfied by your strength
                And by your painful labor, those in the house of a foreigner;</p>
            <p><b>11 </b>
                And you groan at your end,
                When your flesh and your body are consumed;</p>
            <p><b>12 </b>
                And you say, “How I have hated discipline!
                And my heart spurned reproof!</p>
            <p><b>13 </b>
                I have not listened to the voice of my instructors,
                And I have not inclined my ear to my teachers!</p>
            <p><b>14 </b>
                I was almost in utter ruin
                In the midst of the assembly and congregation.”</p>
            <p><b>15 </b>
                Drink water from your own cistern
                And fresh water from your own well.</p>
            <p><b>16 </b>Should your springs be dispersed abroad,
                Streams of water in the streets?</p>
            <p><b>17 </b>
                Let them be for you alone,
                And not for strangers with you.</p>
            <p><b>18 </b>Let your fountain be blessed,
                And be glad in the wife of your youth.</p>
            <p><b>19 </b>
                As a loving hind and a graceful doe,
                Let her breasts satisfy you at all times;
                Be intoxicated always with her love.</p>
            <p><b>20 </b>
                So why should you, my son, be intoxicated with a strange woman
                And embrace the bosom of a foreign woman?</p>
            <p><b>21 </b>
                For the ways of a man are before the eyes of Yahweh,
                And He watches all his tracks.</p>
            <p><b>22 </b>His own iniquities will capture him who is the wicked one,
                And with the cords of his sin he will be held fast.</p>
            <p><b>23 </b>He will die for lack of discipline,
                And in the abundance of his folly he will stumble in intoxication.</p>
