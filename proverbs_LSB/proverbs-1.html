        <h1>Proverbs 1</h1>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h3>To Know Wisdom</h3>
            <p><b>1 </b>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:</p>
            <p><b>2 </b>To know wisdom and discipline,
                To understand the sayings of understanding,</p>
            <p><b>3 </b>To receive discipline that leads to insight,
                Righteousness, justice, and equity,</p>
            <p><b>4 </b>
                To give prudence to the simple,
                To the youth knowledge and discretion;</p>
            <p><b>5 </b>
                Let the wise man hear and increase in learning,
                And a man of understanding will acquire guidance,</p>
            <p><b>6 </b>To understand a proverb and an enigma,
                The words of the wise and their riddles.</p>
            <p><b>7 </b>The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge;
                Ignorant fools despise wisdom and discipline.</p>
            <h3>The Enticement of Sinners</h3>
            <p><b>8 </b>
                Hear, my son, your father’s discipline
                And do not abandon your mother’s instruction;</p>
            <p><b>9 </b>
                For they are a garland of grace for your head
                And ornaments about your neck.</p>
            <p><b>10 </b>My son, if sinners entice you,
                Do not be willing.</p>
            <p><b>11 </b>
                If they say, “Come with us,
                Let us lie in wait for blood,
                Let us ambush the innocent without cause;</p>
            <p><b>12 </b>Let us swallow them alive like Sheol,
                And whole, as those who go down to the pit;</p>
            <p><b>13 </b>We will find all kinds of precious wealth,
                We will fill our houses with spoil;</p>
            <p><b>14 </b>Cast in your lot with us,
                We shall all have one purse,”</p>
            <p><b>15 </b>
                My son, do not walk in the way with them.
                Withhold your feet from their pathway,</p>
            <p><b>16 </b>
                For their feet run to evil
                And they hasten to shed blood.</p>
            <p><b>17 </b>For it is no use that a net is spread
                In the sight of any bird;</p>
            <p><b>18 </b>
                But they lie in wait for their own blood;
                They ambush their own lives.</p>
            <p><b>19 </b>
                So are the paths of everyone who is greedy for gain;
                It takes away the life of its possessors.</p>
            <h3>The Call of Wisdom</h3>
            <p><b>20 </b>Wisdom shouts in the street,
                She gives forth her voice in the square;</p>
            <p><b>21 </b>
                At the head of the noisy streets she calls out;
                At the entrance of the gates in the city she utters her sayings:</p>
            <p><b>22 </b>“How long, O simple ones, will you love simplicity?
                And scoffers delight in scoffing
                And fools hate knowledge?</p>
            <p><b>23 </b>Turn to my reproof,
                Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you;
                I will make my words known to you.</p>
            <p><b>24 </b>
                Because I called and you refused,
                I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention;</p>
            <p><b>25 </b>
                And you neglected all my counsel
                And were not willing to accept my reproof;</p>
            <p><b>26 </b>
                I will also laugh at your disaster;
                I will mock when your dread comes,</p>
            <p><b>27 </b>When your dread comes like a storm
                And your disaster comes like a whirlwind,
                When distress and anguish come upon you.</p>
            <p><b>28 </b>
                Then they will call on me, but I will not answer;
                They will seek me earnestly but they will not find me,</p>
            <p><b>29 </b>
                Because they hated knowledge
                And did not choose the fear of Yahweh.</p>
            <p><b>30 </b>
                They were not willing to accept my counsel,
                They spurned all my reproof.</p>
            <p><b>31 </b>So they shall eat of the fruit of their way
                And be satisfied with their own devices.</p>
            <p><b>32 </b>
                For the turning away of the simple will kill them,
                And the complacency of fools will destroy them.</p>
            <p><b>33 </b>
                But he who listens to me shall dwell securely
                And will be at ease from the dread of evil.”</p>
