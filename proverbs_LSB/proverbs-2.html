        <h1>Proverbs 2</h1>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h3>Yahweh Gives Wisdom</h3>
            <p><b>1 </b>My son, if you will receive my words
                And treasure my commandments within you,</p>
            <p><b>2 </b>To make your ear pay attention to wisdom,
                Incline your heart to discernment;</p>
            <p><b>3 </b>
                For if you call out for understanding,
                Give your voice for discernment;</p>
            <p><b>4 </b>
                If you seek her as silver
                And search for her as for hidden treasures;</p>
            <p><b>5 </b>
                Then you will understand the fear of Yahweh
                And find the knowledge of God.</p>
            <p><b>6 </b>For Yahweh gives wisdom;
                From His mouth come knowledge and discernment.</p>
            <p><b>7 </b>
                He stores up sound wisdom for the upright,
                A shield to those who walk in integrity,</p>
            <p><b>8 </b>To guard the paths of justice,
                And He keeps the way of His holy ones.</p>
            <p><b>9 </b>Then you will understand righteousness and justice
                And equityâ€”every good track.</p>
            <p><b>10 </b>For wisdom will enter your heart
                And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;</p>
            <p><b>11 </b>
                Discretion will keep you,
                Discernment will guard you,</p>
            <p><b>12 </b>
                To deliver you from the way of evil,
                From the man who speaks perverse things;</p>
            <p><b>13 </b>From those who forsake the paths of uprightness
                To walk in the ways of darkness;</p>
            <p><b>14 </b>Who are glad to do evil
                And they rejoice in the perversity of evil;</p>
            <p><b>15 </b>Whose paths are crooked,
                And who are devious in their tracks;</p>
            <p><b>16 </b>To deliver you from the strange woman,
                From the foreign woman who flatters with her words;</p>
            <p><b>17 </b>
                Who forsakes the close companion of her youth
                And forgets the covenant of her God;</p>
            <p><b>18 </b>
                For her house sinks down to death
                And her tracks descend to the dead;</p>
            <p><b>19 </b>
                All who go to her will not return,
                And they will not reach the paths of life.</p>
            <p><b>20 </b>So that you will walk in the way of good men
                And keep to the paths of the righteous.</p>
            <p><b>21 </b>For the upright will dwell in the land
                And the blameless will remain in it;</p>
            <p><b>22 </b>But the wicked will be cut off from the land
                And the treacherous will be torn away from it.</p>
