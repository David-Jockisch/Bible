            <h3>A Father’s Wise Instruction</h3>
            <p><b>1 </b>Hear, O sons, the discipline of a father,
                And pay attention that you may know understanding,</p>
            <p><b>2 </b>
                For I give you sound learning;
                Do not forsake my instruction.</p>
            <p><b>3 </b>When I was a son to my father,
                Tender and the only son before my mother,</p>
            <p><b>4 </b>
                Then he instructed me and said to me,
                “Let your heart hold fast my words;
                Keep my commandments and live;</p>
            <p><b>5 </b>Acquire wisdom! Acquire understanding!
                Do not forget and do not turn away from the sayings of my mouth.</p>
            <p><b>6 </b>Do not forsake her, and she will keep you;
                Love her, and she will guard you.</p>
            <p><b>7 </b>
                The beginning of wisdom is: Acquire wisdom;
                And with all your acquiring, acquire understanding.</p>
            <p><b>8 </b>Prize her, and she will exalt you;
                She will honor you if you embrace her.</p>
            <p><b>9 </b>She will give for your head a garland of grace;
                She will present you with a crown of beauty.”</p>
            <p><b>10 </b>
                Hear, my son, and receive my sayings
                And the years of your life will be many.</p>
            <p><b>11 </b>I have instructed you in the way of wisdom;
                I have led you in upright tracks.</p>
            <p><b>12 </b>
                When you walk, your steps will not be impeded;
                And if you run, you will not stumble.</p>
            <p><b>13 </b>
                Seize discipline; do not let go.
                Guard her, for she is your life.</p>
            <p><b>14 </b>Do not enter the path of wicked men
                And do not step into the way of evil men.</p>
            <p><b>15 </b>Avoid it, do not pass by it;
                Stray from it and pass on.</p>
            <p><b>16 </b>
                For they do not sleep unless they do evil;
                And they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble.</p>
            <p><b>17 </b>
                For they eat the bread of wickedness
                And drink the wine of violence.</p>
            <p><b>18 </b>But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn,
                That shines brighter and brighter until the fullness of day.</p>
            <p><b>19 </b>
                The way of the wicked is like thick darkness;
                They do not know over what they stumble.</p>
            <p><b>20 </b>
                My son, pay attention to my words;
                Incline your ear to my sayings.</p>
            <p><b>21 </b>Do not let them deviate from your eyes;
                Keep them in the midst of your heart.</p>
            <p><b>22 </b>For they are life to those who find them
                And healing to all his flesh.</p>
            <p><b>23 </b>Guard your heart with all diligence,
                For from it flow the springs of life.</p>
            <p><b>24 </b>Put away from you a perverse mouth
                And put devious lips far from you.</p>
            <p><b>25 </b>
                Let your eyes look directly ahead
                And even let your eyelids be fixed straight in front of you.</p>
            <p><b>26 </b>Watch the track of your feet
                And all your ways will be established.</p>
            <p><b>27 </b>Do not turn to the right nor to the left;
                Turn your foot from evil.</p>
