            <h3>Practical Warnings</h3>
            <p><b>1 </b>My son, if you have become a guarantor for your neighbor,
                Have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger,</p>
            <p><b>2 </b>
                If you have been snared with the words of your mouth,
                Have been caught with the words of your mouth,</p>
            <p><b>3 </b>Do this then, my son, and deliver yourself;
                Since you have come into the hand of your neighbor,
                Go, humble yourself, and badger your neighbor.</p>
            <p><b>4 </b>Give no sleep to your eyes,
                Nor slumber to your eyelids;</p>
            <p><b>5 </b>
                Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hunter’s hand
                And like a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
            <p><b>6 </b>
                Go to the ant, O sluggard,
                Observe her ways and be wise,</p>
            <p><b>7 </b>Which, having no chief,
                Officer or ruler,</p>
            <p><b>8 </b>
                Prepares her food in the summer
                And gathers her provision in the harvest.</p>
            <p><b>9 </b>
                How long will you lie down, O sluggard?
                When will you arise from your sleep?</p>
            <p><b>10 </b>
                “A little sleep, a little slumber,
                A little folding of the hands to rest”—</p>
            <p><b>11 </b>
                Your poverty will come in like a vagabond
                And your want like an armed man.</p>
            <p><b>12 </b>A vile person, a wicked man,
                Is the one who walks with a perverse mouth,</p>
            <p><b>13 </b>Who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,
                Who points with his fingers;</p>
            <p><b>14 </b>Who with perversity in his heart continually devises evil,
                Who spreads contentions.</p>
            <p><b>15 </b>Therefore his disaster will come suddenly;
                Instantly he will be broken and there will be no healing.</p>
            <p><b>16 </b>There are six things which Yahweh hates,
                Even seven which are an abomination to Him:</p>
            <p><b>17 </b>
                Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
                And hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
            <p><b>18 </b>A heart that devises wicked thoughts,
                Feet that hasten to run to evil,</p>
            <p><b>19 </b>
                A false witness who breathes out lies,
                And one who spreads strife among brothers.</p>
            <h3>Warning Against Adultery</h3>
            <p><b>20 </b>
                My son, observe the commandment of your father
                And do not abandon the law of your mother;</p>
            <p><b>21 </b>Bind them continually on your heart;
                Tie them around your neck.</p>
            <p><b>22 </b>When you walk about, they will lead you;
                When you sleep, they will keep watch over you;
                And when you awake, they will speak to you.</p>
            <p><b>23 </b>For the commandment is a lamp and the law is light;
                And reproofs for discipline are the way of life</p>
            <p><b>24 </b>To keep you from the evil woman,
                From the smooth tongue of the foreign woman.</p>
            <p><b>25 </b>Do not desire her beauty in your heart,
                Nor let her capture you with her eyelids.</p>
            <p><b>26 </b>
                For on account of a harlot one is reduced to a loaf of bread,
                And an adulteress hunts for the precious life.</p>
            <p><b>27 </b>
                Can a man take fire in his bosom
                And his clothes not be burned?</p>
            <p><b>28 </b>Or can a man walk on hot coals
                And his feet not be scorched?</p>
            <p><b>29 </b>So is the one who goes in to his neighbor’s wife;
                Whoever touches her will not go unpunished.</p>
            <p><b>30 </b>Men do not despise a thief if he steals
                To fill himself when he is hungry;</p>
            <p><b>31 </b>But when he is found, he must repay sevenfold;
                He must give all the substance of his house.</p>
            <p><b>32 </b>
                The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking a heart of wisdom;
                He who would destroy his soul does it.</p>
            <p><b>33 </b>Wounds and disgrace he will find,
                And his reproach will not be blotted out.</p>
            <p><b>34 </b>For jealousy enrages a man,
                And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>
            <p><b>35 </b>He will not accept any ransom,
                He will not be willing though you give many bribes.</p>
