        <h1>Proverbs 3</h1>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h3>Trust, Fear, and Honor Yahweh</h3>
            <p><b>1 </b>My son, do not forget my law,
                But let your heart guard my commandments;</p>
            <p><b>2 </b>For length of days and years of life
                And peace they will add to you.</p>
            <p><b>3 </b>
                Do not let lovingkindness and truth forsake you;
                Bind them around your neck,
                Write them on the tablet of your heart.</p>
            <p><b>4 </b>So you will find favor and good insight
                In the eyes of God and man.</p>
            <p><b>5 </b>
                Trust in Yahweh with all your heart
                And do not lean on your own understanding.</p>
            <p><b>6 </b>
                In all your ways acknowledge Him,
                And He will make your paths straight.</p>
            <p><b>7 </b>Do not be wise in your own eyes;
                Fear Yahweh and turn away from evil.</p>
            <p><b>8 </b>
                It will be healing to your body
                And refreshment to your bones.</p>
            <p><b>9 </b>
                Honor Yahweh from your wealth
                And from the first of all your produce;</p>
            <p><b>10 </b>So your barns will be filled with plenty
                And your vats will burst with new wine.</p>
            <p><b>11 </b>My son, do not reject the discipline of Yahweh
                Or loathe His reproof,</p>
            <p><b>12 </b>For whom Yahweh loves He reproves,
                Even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.</p>
            <p><b>13 </b>How blessed is the man who finds wisdom
                And the man who obtains discernment.</p>
            <p><b>14 </b>For her profit is better than the profit of silver
                And her produce better than fine gold.</p>
            <p><b>15 </b>
                She is more precious than pearls;
                And nothing you desire compares with her.</p>
            <p><b>16 </b>
                Length of days is in her right hand;
                In her left hand are riches and glory.</p>
            <p><b>17 </b>Her ways are pleasant ways
                And all her pathways are peace.</p>
            <p><b>18 </b>She is a tree of life to those who seize her,
                And all those who hold her fast are blessed.</p>
            <p><b>19 </b>
                Yahweh by wisdom founded the earth,
                By discernment He established the heavens.</p>
            <p><b>20 </b>By His knowledge the deeps were split up
                And the skies drip with dew.</p>
            <p><b>21 </b>My son, let them not deviate from your eyes;
                Guard sound wisdom and discretion,</p>
            <p><b>22 </b>
                So they will be life for your soul
                And grace for your neck.</p>
            <p><b>23 </b>Then you will walk in your way securely
                And your foot will not stumble.</p>
            <p><b>24 </b>
                When you lie down, you will not be in dread;
                You will lie down, and your sleep will be pleasant.</p>
            <p><b>25 </b>
                Do not be afraid of sudden dread
                Nor of the storm of the wicked when it comes;</p>
            <p><b>26 </b>For Yahweh will be your confidence
                And will keep your foot from being caught.</p>
            <p><b>27 </b>Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,
                When it is in your hand to do it.</p>
            <p><b>28 </b>
                Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come back,
                And tomorrow I will give it,”
                When it is there with you.</p>
            <p><b>29 </b>
                Do not devise harm against your neighbor,
                While he lives securely beside you.</p>
            <p><b>30 </b>Do not contend with a man without cause,
                If he has dealt you no harm.</p>
            <p><b>31 </b>Do not envy a man of violence
                And do not choose any of his ways.</p>
            <p><b>32 </b>
                For the devious one is an abomination to Yahweh;
                But His secret council is with the upright.</p>
            <p><b>33 </b>The curse of Yahweh is on the house of the wicked one,
                But He blesses the abode of the righteous.</p>
            <p><b>34 </b>
                Though He scoffs at the scoffers,
                Yet He gives grace to the humble.</p>
            <p><b>35 </b>
                The wise will inherit glory,
                But fools raise up disgrace.</p>
